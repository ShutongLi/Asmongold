"Never trust a Lalafell

















In all seriousness,  don't.      That being said,  I've played every numbered FF title + more.  Huge fan of the series.   That being said I despised FFXI even though I was a fan of Asian MMO's and most of their tropes,  I didn't mind a grind.   I played  games like Lineage 2, PSO, Ragnarok, Aion, Knight Online, etc.  but FFXI and the beta version of FFXIV were enough to put me off any square MMO's.    They just didn't feel right....  especially as numbered FF titles.    

  I had no understanding of what the mastermind genius YoshiP was capable of.   He wanted to create a good MMO, and a great FF game.  Not just a FFXI clone, and that's exactly what he did, he blew it all up, literally, and started fresh.    ARR overhauled everything about the game from the most basic of mechanics (auto-attack, backpedal),  to things we should have expected to begin with that wasn't there (being able to ride a chocobo, moogles, cid).   We got ARR, a title truly deserving of a number.     I'm only half way through Stormblood at the moment of writing this review,  but all the 2.x stuff and Heavensward is enough for me to give this game a 10/10 based on story alone, and according to most, it only gets better from here.  

This review is only covering the MSQ (main scenario/story quest) and basic gameplay.   But if you want to throw everything else in here,  the ultimate raids, the social systems, the cosmetics, the golden saucer,  cute cat girls and soon we will have cute bunny boys.    

This game is just fun, the playerbase is generally kind and helpful because they are excited their game is finally getting some recognition.   It's a good time.  

My only regrets are I never gave ARR a fair shot on release because of how jaded i was about FFXI and FFXIV beta.  

I give this game a 10/10 for a FF title and 8/10 for a MMO,  simply because the type of MMO's I enjoy usually revolve around PVP/RVR.   FFXIV is a fantastic single player and co-op experience, but the PVP is half baked and not really that fun, world pvp is non-existent.  The raids are great usually,  and you have multiple ways to complete them making them as hard or as easy as you want.   The MSQ can be a endless string of fetch and kill quests and you kinda feel like you're just a messenger after awhile, but the narrative is fantastic and some of the cutscenes and story twists are a nice payoff to the slog that can be the MSQ sometimes.    The post ARR 2.x stuff is a prime example,   it takes forever but  the ending makes it all worth it.


TL:DR if you like final fantasy games for their story, charm, quirkiness,  ARR+expansions has all of that.   10/10 as a FF title.   I put it up there with FFTactics/FF6/7/8/9.      As a MMO,  it's social experiences and raids are where it shines,  find yourself a free company or a linkshell and your experience will increase tenfold.     If you don't like reading and DGAF about story, this game isn't for you.   If you skip dialogue you literally skip what makes this game amazing.",2021/07/27,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0

"A while ago, I got the trial of this JUST for Palace of the Dead(a deep dungeon with a high level counterpart) that feels like a roguelike and is individual from your character's external level.

But then a perfect storm of WoW being boring(I was casual anyway for a while so it wasnt a big hurt), WoW streamers switching and talking about the game, hearing the story is PHENOMENAL after the base game, having an IRL friend in game, AND the steam summer sale, I came in, and have TRULY become addicted.

BIGGEST DRAW IS THE STORY. Early on, its grindy, it feels like ""wahhh please get some animal meat to feed my family!"" as is any early MMO quests... Most of the base game is also poorly acted, and a slow burn...

But when I say its a slow burn, once you hit Heavensward(first expansion) EVERYTHING from actors changing, to visuals improving, better animations, the dialogues get deeper and better written, the characters more nuanced.

I HIGHLY recommend the story, I'm only at Heavensward and have been AMAZED so far, and theres still SOOO MUCH and i hear that the best stuff is in the latest expansions. 

However, the payoffs aren't as big if you boost. Just play through, read and take in as much as you can, and by first expansion, everything gets so much better.

Also the social aspect is great. I didn't expect to be so social, and its something I've always heard WoW is lacking recently(but i came into WoW late so it was all I knew). First day of leveling, some random guy gave me an axe he crafted. Another couple was impressed with my bard playing music, so added me and chatted with me for pointers.

I actually CARE and REMEMBER about dungeons. In WoW it would be like, ""ohyea... this boss was kinda important i guess to the story?"" but that boss just felt like an NPC. Integrating the dungeons and some raids with the story make you REALLY remember when you get those dungeons later like, ""Oh yea! That cool moment in the story!""

If you're not in it for the story, it feels like SWTOR and WoW, but different of course in individual mechanics and how the animations feel and look. But a few high end streamers have said they dont care about the story, and have loads of fun at the highest content...

And free trial has everything up until Shadowbringers, just can't trade and you have a 300k in game currency limit, but if you get to that point, you'll have decided if you're sticking around I'm sure.

"TL;DR at the bottom
------
I never anticipated I'd get so emotionally invested in an MMO, but here I am over 500 hours later, having completed the main scenario questline (so far).

Though I had started playing after the release of A Realm Reborn, never experiencing FF14 1.0, I could still appreciate the care and effort that went into crafting this game.
The interface is easy to grasp and the game does an excellent job of getting new players up to speed, even when they start a new role after putting many hours into the game. 

The story and characters are definitely one of the game's greatest strengths, especially when players start pushing into the Shadowbringers expansion. I found myself emotionally invested in what happened to comrades and even villains, and was always eager to see where the story would take me next.

I started the game as a Dragoon (a damage-dealing class), and found combat to be incredibly fun. I cannot speak for every other job because I haven't had a chance to try them, but at the time of this writing I've been learning how to heal as a White Mage and found the job to be just as fun in a different way.
What role best suits you depends on personal taste, but FF14 makes it very easy to switch: all you have to do is talk to the appropriate NPC to start the questline for a particular job and away you go, able to switch between jobs at the push of a button.
The game doesn't explicitly point out where these NPCs are, so a Google search or two may be in order. It can be daunting for new players to look up quests and information as there is so much to do in FF14, but the resources that can be found are incredibly helpful and new player friendly.

Since the base game and the first expansion Heavensward (which has an excellent story) are free to new players there really aren't any excuses to not at least try the game out, see what you think. If you're looking for a fun and engaging epic MMORPG I guarantee you won't be disappointed.


TL;DR
+Incredible story and well-written characters
+Beautiful graphics
+Easy to comprehend interface
+Smooth and fun combat (at least as a Dragoon and White Mage)
+Tons of content to keep players busy
+Friendly and helpful community
+Easy to switch between roles and jobs
+Takes its time to train and build up new players

-Sheer scope of FF14 can be daunting to new players
-Bit of quest padding in the mid-levels
-Though minimal, there is a necessary amount of grinding",2021/07/27,0,0,0,0
"Currently I can not play the game. I decided to buckle down and work on the MSQ to try and get to current content before the new expansion came out but as soon as I made it to Heavensward (coming to isguard) Everytime I load a cut scene the game will crash with no errors to the desktop. This is apparently a known issue with no solve. Just Search FF14 crash with no errors. They'll tell you to run CCleaner, update your drivers or do a clean bootup and I don't think this has ever work for anyone. If you submit a ticket to a gm or a forum post to the official site they will ignore it. I have been trouble shooting and waiting for a reply for over a 2 weeks now. And it's not like I am trying to run the game on a potato either (i7, 16gb ram, RTX 2070) This is a great game but I wouldn't waste any money on it untill this issue gets resolved.",2021/07/27,0,0,0.485148489475250244,0

"[h1]Antiquated and boring, but not a bad game[/h1]
Ff14 isn't a bad game, it's just too similar to other games that have come before it. 

[list]
    [*]Boring tab targeting combat
    [*]Linear story progression
    [*]Boring story which supposedly doesn't get ""good"" until after level 50
    [*]World is incredibly fragmented and has 0 sense of scale
    [*]Mindless easy combat

ff14 plays it incredibly safe and does nothing new. IT IS NOT A BAD GAME. I personally just didn't enjoy it. If you're coming from WoW and expecting some leap in gameplay design, look elsewhere. It does look pretty and is well optimised though.

You get to choose your race and class. You start off in a town that's chosen by whatever class you picked. Its very slow in the beginning but gets faster and funner as time passes. The community is super friendly and non-toxic. 

DLC: The DLC is pretty overpriced for 50 more levels and a few more classes. I wouldn't recommend getting it until you want to get past level 50 and want to do multiple playthroughs as different classes.

Music: The music is phenomenal. every Final Fantasy game's music is amazing and i get a erection every time i listen to one of the songs played in any Final Fantasy game. 

Game play: Exactly the same as any MMO out there. Its average.

Quests: The side quests are simple. Most likely you  have to deliver a package or something like that. Just like the game play, the side quests a just like every MMO.

Story: The story is not that great. Its probably the least best thing about the game (besides paying $15 a month.) I skipped through most of the story text boxes.

Difficulty: Its pretty easy. You regenerate HP after every battle and most enemy's are weak and don't deal a lot of damage. For example, you can kill a level 12 enemy as a level 8. But if you don't have a Square Enix account, then you will have a hard time setting one up.

Allow me to explain, starting with the cons of FFXIV:

[h1] The Bad [/h1]
[list]
[*] Buying the game can be frustrating. There are two methods: through Steam or through Square Enix's websites. If you buy it on one platform you cannot use it on the other. I [b] HIGHLY [/b] recommend looking something up to walk you through it.
[/list]

[h1] The Middling [/h1]
Now, this isn't necessarily a negative, but some might think so.
[list]
[*] This is a story-driven game. It can be difficult to play with friends to go through quests since many of the main story quests will have you go into an instance by yourself. There are hundreds of hours of main story quests (it's thicc af), and almost all of it is good; however, some expansions are better than others and each have their own theme and build off of each other. ARR (vanilla) is arguably the worst, but begins to pick up about halfway through, and the rest of the expansions are excellent with Shadowbringers being one of the best narratives I've seen in an MMORPG.
[*] You can skip entire portions of story quests by purchasing story skips from the Mogstation. If you have disposable income and don't really care for the story, then you can buy these.
[*] Add-ons are against the terms of service since PC players and console players are playing together and add-ons that affect the game's code create unfair gameplay between the two. However, the game functions just fine without them.
[*] Buying the current expansion also unlocks all of the expansions before it. However, [b] BUY SHADOWBRINGERS BEFORE BUYING ENDWALKER. IF YOU BUY ENDWALKER EXPECTING TO HAVE EVERYTHING ELSE, YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PLAY THE CURRENTLY RELEASED CONTENT UNTIL ENDWALKER RELEASES. [/b]
[/list]

[h1] The Good/Excellent [/h1]
As previously stated, I've played WoW for years, and the following game mechanics and features completely outstrip WoW in terms of functionality and enjoyment.
[list]
[*] [b] Your character can be every single class and profession (in FFXIV terms, jobs) and you can switch between them with literally a click of your mouse. [/b] This game respects your time immensely. Tired of playing the Archer/Bard? No problem! Switch on over to your Gladiator/Paladin and nothing changes except your class. Not only that, but classes receive something called an Armory Bonus that increases experience gained up to your maximum leveled class.
[*] Classes are all unique and morph into specialized classes. Class categories share a small pool of general abilities, like basic defensives or casting modifiers.
[*] There are daily quests, mostly in the form of Beast Tribe dailies. You can do 12 of these a day, and they reward you with unique currency that you can spend at the factions along with reputation. It might sound like a small amount of dailies, but the reputation gain is proportional. And better yet, flying isn't gated behind getting reputation with these factions (thank god). The reason this is a pro is due to the fact that it holds no bearing on anything else in the game and nothing is locked behind it (other than faction-specific mounts and pets and whatnot).
[*] The subscription is cheaper than WoW, and they give you veteran rewards every few months that you're subscribed.
[*] Chocobo racing and Gold Saucer nonsense. Be sure the play the mini and jumbo Cactpot (I call the jumbo Cactpot the Cuckedpot though because you'll never win the jackpot).
[*] The UI is entirely customizable down to the colors of enemy and friendly health bars. No need for an add-on or anything to change stuff around.
[*] Random drops exist, but that's not really the focus of the gear game, especially at end game content. Many duties (FFXIV's equivalent to dungeons and raids) will reward you with both random drops and tokens or currency to trade in for [b] specific [/b] pieces of gear. This means you don't have to grind the same raid or trial for the specific drop for weeks, and instead just buy an equivalent piece instead.
[*] Gearing up a class at endgame is incredibly fast so that you can get into the meat and potatoes of the hardcore raiding content.
[*] The duties are all unique and bosses rarely repeat mechanics from other duties. Most of the duties don't have artificial difficulty scalers, like arbitrarily more health or damage. Instead, bosses rely on complex and interesting mechanics. Savage, Extreme, Unreal, and Ultimate boss fights will also scale with health and damage and will require a certain DPS check, but when you're doing these you know what you're in for and what is required.
[*] Duties have their own unique soundtrack, and many bosses also have unique soundtracks and battle music. Honestly, most of it is top tier music.
[*] Almost all previous content is brought forward into the new expansion or content patch. Dungeons from ARR still reward currency that is usable at max level. Some unique content from previous expansions are expanded on and given new activities to do. Gear/stat scaling is applied in a remarkably balanced way. Square Enix routinely patches current and past content, all the way back to 2.0 (ARR vanilla).
[*] The game is pretty. Gear sets are unique to each dungeon, trial, or raid, and many have dyeable versions that can be crafted (I'm looking at you, WoW, with your reskinned gear sets from every dungeon in an expansion). Most harder difficulty content of the same duty rewards equipment that looks completely different from the previous difficulty, or they follow a certain theme. Regardless, the equipment will look different and rarely is it recolored.
[*] Raids and trials aren't long endeavors that take hours upon hours to complete, or even days. Almost all of them can be completed in less than an hour, and if you're there for more than an hour then you're doing something very very wrong.
[*] The crafting in this game is just [i] chef kiss.[/i] The same materials are used more or less throughout the whole game and can be farmed very easily. Not only that, but the game incentivizes you to use the crafting abilities to make high-quality craftables. In fact, it gives you the option to craft it quickly or take your time to really get that good good. There are also a few different types of crafting activities that involve items that are classified as collectables and reward special currency for nifty mounts, minions (pets), and cosmetics.
[*] The list goes on, but go see for yourself. The free trial includes ARR and the award-winning Heavensward expansion up to level 60 with no restrictions to the amount of time played. There are, however, some restrictions regarding social functions and in-game marketboard stuff.
[/list]

[h1] The Verdict: 9/10 [/h1]
FFXIV is one of the best MMORPGs currently available with a storyline that hooks deep into your gills. The game has many quality of life features that surpass its competitors. It also respects your time. The free trial is also exceptionally generous.",2021/07/26,9,0,0.632592558860778809,1

"I have no idea how to review an MMO. All I know is that, the story is good, as well are some of the side-missions. Combat is fun, rewarding and engaging especially by MMO standards. The community at large is very patient and helpful. The world and graphics are beautiful and seemingly endless. Music is always good for FF games but there are times where it amps it up and gets even more thrilling. Even something like fishing or gathering is shockingly fun despite how simple it is.

The most important part is that the Devs have passion and actually give a shit about their game. It's no wonder this is one of the top MMO's.",2021/07/26,0,0,0,0

"Playtime isn't quite accurate as I have about 30 hours played on the Squenix launcher version before I switched to steam. 

If you're thinking about taking the plunge, do it. This game is absolutely fantastic. I used to mainly play Destiny 2 but got sick of how the way things were and decided to finally try FFXIV. I am so glad I did! The game is a little difficult to get into at the start, but if you really stick with it, I promise you'll enjoy the adventures within. 

FFXIV Online is a very story heavy MMORPG, and I prefer to think that the initial journey is a RPGMMO before it is a MMORPG. A Realm Reborn is the base game, and is unfortunately rife with tedious fetch quests. However, when the game pops off, it REALLY pops off. Once you get to the Post ARR Patch Quests, that's when the game starts getting amazing. The dungeons get significantly better, the Trials (Boss Fights) skyrocket in terms of quality, and overall the game just has much better pacing and direction. 

Gameplay is very solid. At the beginning, you have barely any skills and its relatively mindless to just go around and kill stuffs, but as you progress, the way you utilize your skills becomes exponentially more interesting and fun. Dungeon mechanics are very simple from the start, but eventually become more and more complex, to the point that some mechanics remind me of how coordinated you have to be in Destiny raids, and we haven't even mentioned raiding in this game yet. Trials are where the game truly starts to shine. Base versions of Trials can be cleared with relative ease, but you can unlock higher difficulty versions and they are so awesome. The Raids are like next level phenomenal. There are 24 man raids and 8 man raids, each serving their own purpose. These are honestly where the best replayable content pieces are. Square really outdid themselves with these.

There is a PvP mode but I have yet to try it, will come back to update once I have formed a proper opinion.

Class/Role selection in FFXIV is fantastic. You literally don't need alternate characters because 1 character can do everything, but you can make alts anyways! Best idea ever. The way it works is you select a Role at character creation, and really all that does is select which of the 3 starting locations you arrive in. You can choose to stick with that role until you unlock the Job (Real Class) associated with it by unlocking your Job Stone at level 30, or switch to another role once you unlock Main Scenario Quests that are level 15. The agency to choose is kind of unreal. From there, you can switch jobs whenever you please by changing what weapon you have equipped. Plus, there is a gear auto selector that will help you gear up and it's honestly a life savor. 

When creating your initial character, you'll be tasked with selecting a Data Center and a Server within said Data Center. There are 3 US Data Centers and it doesn't really matter which one you choose, as Data Center Traveling will allow for visiting wherever you want. Inside your Data Center, you can Server visit (World Visit) whenever you please. Friend started on Cactuar but you're on Siren? No worries, just go to the Aetheryte Plaza and swap over to his World. EZ.

"If you add my free trial hours, I'm currently almost 400 hours into the game and I feel like I've only seen 1% of it and its already worth the money.

Story gets extremely good later on and the boss fights are epic. Community is extremely wholesome, and if you're lucky, you can catch player-coordinated concerts at major city squares. Everyone in the dungeons/trials I've participated in so far have all been very friendly and patient to newcomers such as myself, and will explain boss mechanics to us to help us learn and grow.

Looking forward to finishing Shadowbringers and I hope to be a part of this community in years to come, don't delay any further, just buy the game",2021/07/26,1,0,0.523809552192687988,2

"Been playing for a short while now. I am a WoW convert. After Shadowlands 9.1, I became extremely disallusioned to WoW and decided to try FF14 as a pissy form of protest.

The game is incredible. It is what I wish WoW was.

Cons:
- Navigating the UI has a bit of a skill curve in my mind. Maybe that's just the fact I came from WoW.
- Although I feel they did the best they can with controller controls, they aren't great. Use Keyboard/Mouse
- Edit: I forgot to mention the registration and log on experience. It is VERY frustrating. The free trial basically does not work. I have had 3 people try it.

Pros:
Literally everything else. This game is truly something special. If you get it and put time into it, look up what FF14 1.0 was like. It is an exact mirror of WoW. Early WoW was huge. After years, it started to decline, while early FF14 was ROUGH. But, with love and care, they made it one of the top rated sub MMOs ever.",2021/07/26,0,0,0,0
"Absolutely GARBAGE. Followed the hype, thought I'd check out a new mmo... I can't even install the freaking thing. I tried installing with the square enix launcher and on steam with the same issue it just wont work. Found some advice on an ancient website from 1995 saying i should deactivate my  antivirus protection and change my DNS configuration as well as find some files buried deep in my system to check a one to a zero and it still will not even install. Then there's the issue where you CAN'T even get your money back for this POS that wont even run. At one point it says to run it with the Vista compatibility, but it was I need the Vista service pack 2, run it as Vista Service pack 2 and nothing ... This is absolutely absurd I'm over it, keep the 20 bucks you scammed from me Square Enix ya aholes.",2021/07/26,0,2,0.382165610790252686,1

"I don't like many graphic elements like the glowing thing around windows/crystals which is appalling or the terrain in many occasions.I think most of the graphics need to be reworked asap it feels like i am playing lineage 2.In some areas the design feels like random assets from different games.
I don't understand why you need to be stuck behind the main story quests especially the post Reborn quests where there is no real progression with your character.I know its the story but many of those are just bland text and teleportation around the map for no reason.At least some more voice acting would be nice.

Despite what i believe about the graphics design and the MSQ line the game generally is good with a lot of depth behind it and a lot of potential.The combat feels nice and the character class change system is truly great.

I really hope with the rising population the game will upgrade graphically.Imagine FFXIV with monster hunter graphics...a masterpiece.",2021/07/26,0,0,0.476190477609634399,0

Negatives: Account creation is a huge pain in the ass; the UI is way too large with no way to scale it down; graphics are good but not quite as good as I'd expect with my 1060 at 70-90% usage; the map system is complete garbage (no easy zoom out option, have to follow a branching path to find quest objectives, etc). Positives: gameplay itself is excellent, if the difference between class and job is not explained well; playerbase is very nice overall and has a good perspective on new players; bosses are fun, though I wish their telegraphed attacks were a tad more imaginative.

"I rarely write reviews for games because it's annoying to do but i felt it necessary on this one because i am absolutely in love with this game. being a WoW refugee i wanted to try a different experience and FFXIV was the right call. I love the multi-class system, being able to choose what class I want and leveling them up separately really gives a sense of worth to investing your time into different classes. It also gives a way to have different playstyles without having to make an all-new character if you're already invested in the one you've made. Another great thing about this game is the way outfits and armor is handled, most mmos have all the good fashion locked behind some sort of pay wall and while there is an optional store it really and truly is optional, the game makes no attempt to push the store page in your face like other mmos such as BDO. All gear in the can in some degree be obtainable through the in game monetary system whether it be the in-game market or special vendors.  The story of FFXIV is entertaining and managed to hold my attention for a good deal of time it didn’t feel as though it went on too long and the first expansion A Realm Reborn was an excellent intro into everything I needed to know and mixed in difficult but fair dungeons and boss battles as I progressed to keep me entertained. Overall this is a solid and well deserving of all the praise and attention it’s getting so fair, with a solid and healthy community a wellspring of story to uncover and experience, a dynamic job/class system that will keep you entertained for hours, this is certainly a solid pick if you’re looking to get into a new mmo or break away from older ones like I did, don’t let the initial price point fool you this is definitely worth the 19.99.",2021/07/25,0,0,0,0

"Having never played an MMORPG before, Final Fantasy 14 was my first experience in the genre, which differs greatly from the experience of seasoned MMO veterans that come from games like World of Warcraft. I had no general preconception of what to expect out of an MMO, other than I would have a fuck ton of grinding to do and a bunch of quests to complete. For the most part, while this was true, Final Fantasy 14 was more than that. Simply being presented to the world in the opening cinematic that showed a badass fucking dragon burning everything ablaze was awesome. The game presents you with the narrative that you are an adventurer fresh off the boat with brimming potential and new experiences to overcome as the game progresses.

Starting with the story, it's phenomenal as literally anybody who has reached up till the second expansion of Heavensward will tell you. A Realm Reborn was not the greatest, truth be told it was a painful grind that burnt me out from the game because of all the fetch quests around the middle part of the MSQ (Main Scenario Quest), especially with no prior tolerance for it given my lack of an MMO background. Generally taking it slow and enjoying the pace of things is a good way to go throughout A Realm Reborn, especially the patches that come after it. There will be tons of moments in the story where you'll be forced to shed a tear, or even pose questions towards the villains of the story on whether or not they are justified in their means. Shadowbringers, in particular, was my favourite expansion. It beautifully told the story covering events that occurred even in A Realm Reborn, which stresses the notion that even though ARR may seem sluggish to get through at first, understanding it is a good way to go in keeping up with most references in the future expansions. 

One thing I've noticed is that this game likes to bring up past characters from even the most irrelevant of quests. While most people may not remember these NPC's, it's always a cool little easter egg for the players that do remember as it allows the player to ponder back to that memory and get a sense of how they have been keeping up since then, as both you and the NPC have come ways since that point in time. Overall, the later expansions after ARR made me go through a roller coaster of emotions, from shedding a tear, to posing moral questions on whether the villains of the story are actually in the wrong, and some laughs here and there, amongst many other things. Most of the voice actors are upgraded heavily from Heavensward onwards; though I prefer the Japanese voice acting, it's mostly a matter of preference. While there may be a lot of reading to do in between dialogue throughout ARR, I've noticed a significant amount of voice-acted scenes after ARR. The best thing about FFXIV is that it presents the dialogue in bite-size formats where you can consume the information more leisurely as opposed to reading the bible's equivalent. 

Gameplay-wise, as a sprout, I generally took a lot of time to learn the core mechanics of the game. I'm still learning for that matter, and learn new things every day. Players generally have a friendly attitude towards new players, and will not hesitate to give you advice should you ask for it. However, at least in my experience, when a player does not ask and a mistake is clear, most people do their best to avoid speaking and simply move on with the instance as it does not hinder completion unless in very extreme circumstances. While there is no entitlement of players to do so, and with the game already doing a horrid job of introducing some aspects of how to play your class or job early on with Hall of the Novice being mediocre in that regard, I believe this has mostly to do with the lingering fear of a report. Square Enix is generally strict in their penalties, and it has resulted in a lot of players being approached with hostility as the person being given advice generally sees the critique on their gameplay as an attack and no player wants to deal with the drama of consoling a tank that isn't using their mitigation cooldowns going back and forth about how the healer is supposed to adjust. Once again, I blame this mostly on how the game lacks emphasis on teaching people how to play their jobs or classes correctly.  In my particular circumstance as a fresh player to MMO's and foreign to the mechanics of the game, YouTube guides were my best friend and I strongly encourage looking up class guides, dungeon guides, beginner tips, or generally anything you can think of as it would most likely have a guide for it on YouTube. 

While I have not attempted much of the higher-end content as I am a sprout that has more or less just finished the MSQ 3 weeks ago and levelling other jobs to find which one is a fit for me, I have enjoyed the normal game mode provided in the instances throughout the MSQ, especially post-ARR. Speaking of levelling, FFXIV is very friendly towards trying out new classes, as you can play all of them on one character. Upon obtaining certain accessories, you can get bonuses of up to 30% experience, and if you register on a preferred server the experience gain goes up by (+100%). If a job that is levelled is lower than the job with the highest level you have unlocked, you also get an armoury bonus that provides a significant amount of EXP to help catch you up. Unlockable classes that are locked between future expansions also pick off from certain levels (30, 50, 60), giving you all your skills and beginning your progression from that point forward.

Overall, I've enjoyed FFXIV. This review is mostly my initial impression and I have barely scratched the surface in experiencing much of what this game has to offer. If you are looking to pour a shit load of hours into a game that has a very welcoming and friendly community, I'd recommend giving it a shot.

Don't get me wrong - the endless grinds, boring leveling, and rare drops are here. However, it seems to be done in a different fashion.

As a former WoW player, I have gone through a few other MMOs, and this one (aside from WoW) is the one that caught most of my attention up. Now I am enjoying a bit of Swords of Legends Online, and will soon adventure myself in the universe of the New World. After that, I am more than likely to be visiting this awesome game!

"First, I'm not an Anime fan and was the only reason I didn't get this game a while ago. I'm also not a fan or have anything against final fantasy in general. The game is not in your face about the Anime, and the graphics, cutscenes are good and compelling. It really is visually pleasing and I'm glad I gave it a try.

The critism of the game that I've been reading are really shallow in my opinion, except for one... which is the main quest line is very, very long. I've been playing about a week now, and there is so much content to explore that I not only enjoyed (CRAFTING IS AMAZING, dungeons, fates, etc), but I lost track of the main story line. That can be a good or bad thing depending on how you look at it. The journey through the main quest is good and NOT boring.

Others have said this game is an RPGMMO, not an MMORPG. I would agree. This has all the elements you would expect with an MMO, but the story places you as the hero, which is why the main story line is so heavy. But it's interesting, even for me having no interest in the final fantasy series.

Combat is good. People say it's slower, because of the cooldowns being half a second to a second longer... but to me at least, it doesn't feel slower in terms of whats going on in battle. 

Classes and alt characters... has the best design choices I've ever seen. You don't have to create an Alt and start from the begining if you want to play a tank. You just select that alt class on your character menu or hotbar however you set it up. Each class has it's own leveling system and skills like you'd expect. The great thing is, you don't have to go through the entire story again, and you have all your crafting abilities and unlocks from the game. GENIUS!!!

In my experience, community also has been very friendly and helpful to new players.

Overall I think it's a well balanced game, and so far has been a lot of fun.",2021/07/24,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0

"Is this a good game?

Yes and no

The ""Yes"":
The story. Just amazing. 
It is like watching (and reading) a hole 6 season of a fantasie movie. Hope, despair, betrayal, friendship, mindblowing fantasy. Final Fantasy at its best. I think it is even better then all the singel player FF games, because it hase more time to explain why things happen and why you are doing things.

I like the different locations, the dungeons, the classes, the battle system.
There are even some goofy quests and questlines that are just there to make you laugh out loud.

The ""No"":
The registration page. Square Enix realy does not like getting your money ;)

The Story. [b]Wait what? Didnt i just write the story is a strong point?[/b]
Well while lvling up and at this point (Shadowbringers), you have to play all the 18 chapters of the main Story. Beginning with the base games 6 chapters. They are all mandatory for progression and unlocking content.

In the beginning you just enjoy it, but after a couple hours i asked myself: Hmmm when can i actualy play the game?
And the longer i played, the more i got this feeling that i am not playing a game, that im just in an interactive Movie, that lets me taste, what the game is or might be, just to burry me with so much story i forgot i actualy used any skills in my skillbars.

I think there can be to much story in a Game - and FF14 absolutely has to much story - amazing story, but to much for my taste.

Now im in chapter 14 of the 18 avaliable ones. And watching the cutscenes and story text bits, feels more like a grinding 10'000 wolfs that have a ridiculous low chance of dropping a a claw in another MMO. Sometimes i kinda wish i would farm those wolfes, rather than watching a cutscene, and a cutscene and then again a cutscene, to kill 1 mob and watch 1-2h cutscenes again.

So is it a good game? Yes and no

Maby FF14 becomes a game after you reach lvl 80 and finish all the mandatory story quests. But till then and where i am right now, its more an interactive movie, that lets you play the game from time to time.

I will update this review when i hit max lvl and see the light in the tunnel that is the main story line.",2021/07/24,1,0,0.500171780586242676,0

Be a Dps that Kills anything in thier pass . Or a Healer that ... heals with the power of a 1000 gods SUCKING THE BLOOD FROM THE GODS RIGHT IN TO Dyeing teammates faces . So yes this game is so much fun and if you like WoW i would recommend this game because i played WoW and did not have a lot a fun but this is WoW on CRACK (and weeb stuff) SOO is it worth the payment per month no because i had spent already 20$ on this game just to start it and now i must pay monthly look this game is good but this is upserd anyways wait until the games under %5 off because This game is worth the $10 or $5 idk money per month so not the 20$ to start the game up . 9/10,2021/07/24,0,0,0.479452043771743774,0

"I am NOT a WoW refugee. I like to play MMOs and was looking for something different not having played one in a few years. So at 25 hours this is a ""first impressions"" review from a ±30 year seasoned MMO grinder/raider. Unnecessarily difficult and convoluted to even log-in. You try to register with your AV running, nope have to wait another day and try again. JFC Why?! Mobs are way to easy to kill. 3-4 hits and dead? even for a starting area thats very boring. The starting area is claustrophobic, Wheres the open world? I hated that and it bugged me. I wanted to look across valleys and rivers not down another narrow street. And Zones?! Are we back to Everquest and zones?! Hello 1999! Recently I found out theres a newbie chat... what?! boy that would have been more helpful if it were say.. oh... I dunno maybe automatically added to your chat window as a new player? Newbie chat doesnt do a newbie any good if its double super secret, does it? Never talked or need to to talk to anyone, felt like ESO all over again. Not much of a MMO if you dont need to interact. So I tried a Sentinel, seemed like a different take on melee DPS but it was unimpressive and disappointing. I just lost interest at lvl 15, nothing grabbed me, nothing stood out, nothing made me want more. I dreaded leveling this class. Having played ±2 dozen MMOs since the 1990s I just found this to be... ""ponderous"". Maybe im burned out on MMOs but I have no desire to grind any class in this game even though I hear it has good end game raiding. One thing I've learned is dont grind a game you dont love and I do not love this game. I'll recommend it to try if you like MMOs but Its not for me. I really hope you have a better experience.

"FAIR WARNINGS: 
1-Starting the game is REALLY slow pace and it can gets boring. 
2- the game VERY complicated with little to no explanation. Thanks internet for the help.
3- insure which server data center you should join otherwise you will need pay to real money to switch servers (i recommend Balmung Server, though not sure if its the best). ignore the connection quality not much difference.
4- Make sure when you making your character you're completely satisfied with it especially the voice, otherwise you will need to pay real money to change your character looks and name.
5- Playing this game requires Online subscription. 
6- there is no voice chatting in the game sadly. not that i know of anyways.

If you push through all the above and take your time , you will truly enjoy the game and great community.

"Came to this game after getting a bit stale with ESO. Having fun with it so far and it's a little addictive. lol. Finished the base game content on my Paladin character and now doing Heavensward. 

Things I like: Friendly, helpful player base. Flying around a great landscape, combat definitely becomes more varied as you level up and acquire new skills. I also like the fact you can play different ""job"" roles on the same character without having to log into another character at all. Indirectly I think this keeps the community a bit more ""well-behaved"" than some other MMO's I could mention. :)

The game is heavily focused around the Main story quest (which grants the quickest way of levelling as a ""sprout""). Some people complain it's a grind in the early stages, with mundane quests where you basically go from one place to another running errands, listen to a lot of story dialogue, with intermittent combat scenarios. But the opportunities for varied gameplay opens up the more you play it, I think. And I enjoyed the story finale. 
You can do dungeons, raids, trials, join a ""free company"" (similar to guilds), ""fate"" encounters, crafting and much more. 

Finally, the music is often stunning, particularly battle music. And as a musician I love that aspect of it. So I'll be staying with this for a while.",2021/07/23,2,0,0.53125,0

Nice community that will help out any new sproutlings
Music is everywhere and will create ambiance during a cutscene or dialogue
A nice little currency system that can help you purchase catch up gear along the road so it isn't that painful
Variety of classes AND you get the story line for each job class which is cool

"I've literally played this game since A Realm Reborn was in early access. I've seen it all. Done most of it. Experienced it across three different consoles (PS3, PS4, and now PC), played for thousands of hours, poured my heart and soul into this world. I never liked MMO's before this game, but FFXIV made me love this one. If I had one critique, it's that A Realm Reborn is exceedingly slow, but the rebalancing they did some time back made it much better and it's 100% worth going through; but don't skip! The world building is important! Eorzea is a wonderful online home and I've met so many great people and introduced it to so many of my friends. And Shadowbringers is quite literally the best Final Fantasy story we've gotten since...probably X in my opinion. My wedding ceremony was themed after FFXIV even because my husband and I have spent so much of our relationship playing this game together.

"I am still pretty new to MMOs compared to most people (my first MMO was Classic WoW launch 2~ years ago), but as a somewhat casual player, this game has been an amazing experience for me so far.

Dunno how else to put it, but it's an MMO where the leveling and questing feels like a single player game, in a good way where the MMO aspects are still definitely there. It also feels like this game respects my time a lot more than Classic WoW. I am pretty sure this feeling comes from me never playing WoW before, and most people who already did are just flying through the TBC Classic content. An influx of new players to FFXIV has made feel like I really do fit in. I just feel like there are sooooo many more people I can relate to in this game compared to Classic WoW.

"The character creation is fun and more detailed than some other games I've played. The naming is also really interesting because you have to pick a first and last name which makes it pretty easy to get the name you'd like. Right now the servers are over full and you might have to wait a few minutes to get in game but it hasn't taken too long on the North America side. The story lines are fun and interesting. There are some scenes that were completely unexpected for me, like the frequent implication that SA has occurred. It is never explicitly stated but heavily implied. If you're someone who needs to be aware of that, here is your warning. 
The combat is not overly hard, in fact it can be somewhat boring at times, but that also means it is easier to learn. Healing in the game is really simple which can be fun!

"AMAZING game!..... However, the early hours are awful!

FFXIV wonderfully created a nice story and class system in an MMO package. There's a lot to do and gradually there's more and more stuff going on. The story gets better, the classes get more interesting, the zones grow more and more alien,,,, So far the gradual increase in excitement hasn't faltered

There is 1 flaw and it's a pretty big one! The first 15 or so hours!
Spend these hours with friends or something else on your second monitor. I hope the devs make the early game more interesting in the future. For now it consists of a lot of uninteresting filler quests and barebones classes. The classes gradually gain more abilities as you level but that does not take away that the game gets pretty boring when all you do is cycle through 3 abilities. 

If you can get through this flaw there will be an amazing game opening up for you",2021/07/22,0,0,0,0

Story is fantastic and leads you through to the end. 
No weird hanging off the cliff each time at the end of a patch. They try to tie off a story chapter and open a new chapter each time.
Dungeons are awesome, and traditional MMO feel is fantastic
Having 1 character and being able to play ANYTHING is great! This is my favorite feature!

Leveling is just not intuitive enough outside of story quests. FATES were nerfed years ago.
Daily dungeon is the only reward worth it to level. There is a balance between adventure and time spent. I just felt I didn't get anything done after 4+ hours.

Once I got into HW I was completely hooked. The story completely captivated me and I've achieved a level of immersion I don't think I've ever experianced in an MMO. I've only had this game for about 3 weeks and going on 200 hours if that says anything.

Which basically makes your paladin lvl 70 right off the bat..... Also keep in mind you can also do this with many other classes, allowing you if you want to buy your classes and skip the quest for them and hit lvl 70 easily.

"Tried this game hoping it would fill the void that WoW left many years ago. I found this game doesn't hold a candle to what WoW once was, and is all around a bad MMO. 

Cons
-For an mmo, there is a striking lack of group content. Want to level with friends? Too bad, play solo.
-The combat is completely uninteresting for the first 30ish hours of the game. Your kit will only start to come together past level 40. 
- This game holds your hand TIGHT. The entire main story quest, which is the main method of leveling and is required to unlock all content in the game, is one massive tutorial. I would have enjoyed even a minor challenge at one point. From what I have heard, the challenge does not increase until you get into end game raids.
- Some people seem to enjoy the story, but to me it felt very stiff and hard to get into. I bet the lore could actually be interesting, but the delivery imo is atrocious. Was hoping my love for grinds could get me through but after 40 hours and still not being done with the tutorial (main story quest) I gave up. 
-money doesn't seem to serve much of a purpose and was very easy to come by. I usually enjoy crafting quite a bit, but due to having no need for money, there didn't feel like a point.
-pvp systems aren't built out. Admittedly, I don't have much experience with the pvp but it is definitely an afterthought at best.

Pros
-crafting systems seem well thought out and interesting. If only money mattered...
-if you like RP, this may be a good game for you.
-If you like playing to dress up a character, this game may be for you.

Overall, i'd give this game at best a 2/10. I have heard end game raiding is fun, however, it is not worth it to grind minimum of 80 hours of a boring story-line with no challenge to reach max level to see if you enjoy the raiding. The grind to end game is unrewarding and a slog. Do not recommend unless you are heavily into the RP side of the game, or just love the FF world.",2021/07/21,2,2,0.492028594017028809,0

"I have been playing this game for years. The story and community is what keeps bringing me back for more. The story starts off slow so it's not too overwhelming, but picks up and really starts flourishing once you get into expansion content. While the game starts slow, I think it is a great way to really introduce mechanics and the prologue for the story in the first 30 levels. The key to unlocking content in this game is to keep at the MSQ (Main Story/Scenario Quests). 

Does the server I start on matter?
Make sure to pick a server that makes sense for you - they are based in North America, Europe, and Japan - and coming soon: Oceania! You will get better ping if you choose a server closest to your region. There are sometimes ""Preferred"" servers (and will be marked as such) where the population is lower, so the game will give you level boosts up to level 70, gil (gold/currency) initial gift, and an additional 15 days of subscription once you hit level 30.

As far as fighting content?
Everything picks up past level 30 with a steady stream of new playable content including quests (with some humor in them), dungeons, trials (boss-only fights), and raids (against great ff lore enemies, not PvP) - but there is also PvP arenas for those who like PvP! I like that you can swap classes at any point past level 10 - so if you don't like the class you picked at first you can try a different one without restarting with a new character, and still keep your progress towards the other classes. If you want to play another class, just put on the gear for it! They even make that easy by allowing you to create a gear set for easy swapping in the Character tab.

What about non-fighting content?
There is a healthy crafting market with several crafting and gathering classes, and a very interesting RP (role-play) community! You will find in the evening hours that RP players will host events and turn their houses into venues such as clubs, restaurants, farmer's markets, and bath houses (among lots of other things) - Just look in your server's Party Finder for ads to these places.  You'll also find mini games and events called GATEs in The Gold Saucer, including the card game Triple Triad - some of these cards you win through playing NPCs, or drops in dungeons and trials.

What if your friends are on different servers?
Currently, the game has a way to play cross-server within the same data center so you can teleport to another server to play with your friends! It has been announced that the devs are working on making cross-data center play possible to play with friends on other data centers.

What about the community?
There is a steady, predictable stream of new content with every patch being approx every two months. The development team is considerate of the player base's wants for the game and honestly looks at possibilities to incorporate them when able. The community is overall great. There are a few rotten apples like in every MMO, but the GMs actually respond to reports within 24 hours and give out warnings and bans to those who break community standards pretty consistently, so overall being a butt is not tolerated here.  The game has The Novice Network that new players have access to to ask questions to long-time players called Mentors for advice. Make use of this!

The Technical Stuff You Should Know:
Additionally, the game is available on PC, Mac, PS4, and now PS5 - so pick which ever platform makes sense for you. Just know in order to play the game, when you buy the game, you need to apply the registration code for the game (and any expansions you buy) to your MogStation account - you will also use account this to pay for the game every month. You also have different payment options. You can use a debit card, Crysta points (their way of prepay loading money onto the account - parents that pay for their kid's accounts might find this useful so the kids aren't buying things they aren't supposed to), and using your Steam Wallet (if you play the PC or Mac versions).",2021/07/21,0,0,0,0

"Played through the main game and Heavensward now so my opinion is based on this content.

[b]Story:[/b]
This is the main selling point for many players and I agree that the story is good for an MMORPG. Don't expect anything groundbreaking though. The themes are universal and the use of stilistic methods is uninspiring. There are twists and turns but if you have read a number of great books, watched certain AAA TV series or movies then XIV's story is mediocre at best. The execution of the story telling is really tedious for a game. 
Most characters are forgettable despite the fact that dialogues provide plenty of interactions between them. And these dialogues can become a second full time job to get through.

[b]Animations and graphics:[/b]
With the exception of very few cutscenes the presentation did not age well. I hated XIII but XIV has much worse presentation than that horrific game.

[b]Music:[/b]
Top notch. Much variety. High quality. There were uncountable moments where I was blown away by the soundtrack.

[b]Gameplay:[/b]
 I mostly played Archer/Bard and I liked the design of the job. There is, however, no way of tracking how you perform (no dps meter) unless you want to get banned for using ACT.

Would I recommend it? As the main game and HW are free one might think it is a no brainer. But you always invest time and a lot of it when it comes to an MMO. To huge Final Fantasy fans I would recommend it with some disclaimers. Anyone who is expecting an alternative to WoW should stay away from XIV. This game is story driven and mostly single player. The story is forgettable though if you demand originality, immersion and to be blown away. The gameplay is ok but WoW is simply better. (Btw. I am not playing WoW anymore because of its horrible design.)
The reason why I cannot recommend this game while continuing to play is simple. I know that most players - unlike myself - want short-term gratification and there is nothing wrong with it. Gaming should all be about joy and a reliable way to be entertained. After spending 200 hours of main quest chores I still cannot tell if it is going to be worth it eventually for me. All I know is that I invested a massive amount of time of my life. What for? I yet have to find out. All I know is that Blizzard does not value my time as a player and I get the same impression from SE since years now.

Don't make the mistake of thinking you can level up within 2 days and have a blast with end game. I spent over 100 hours now with main quest chores which are mandatory. You cannot progress unless you finish the story and the is a lot of really bad content to waste your life on.",2021/07/21,1,1,0.517241418361663818,0
"Keeping in mind this is an RPGMMO, not an MMORPG. Unlike MMORPGs, this is more story driven and less about reaching that next level. It's about the journey, not the destination, as i have heard it put. To me, it's everything that WoW was, back in the day, when you would actually call in to work/school just to stay home and play.  Interesting, challenging, great community, beautiful graphics and music... just plain fun, even if you are not into the Final Fantasy series!",2021/07/21,0,0,0,0
"I've been playing this MMO for a long time now, I am a more casual consumer of games in contrast to most of my peers. This MMO is one of the few that feels like it doesn't punish you for playing at your own pace. Its very consumer friendly that way.

The way the Level and Gear Syncing work, and the ability to control the syncing for your own groups, allows for new players, new FCs, and older players to experience the content as if it were current content again. Though as the expansions pass by abilities will cease to exist for some classes, it never detracts from the game play of the dungeons, trials and raids, so you slowly forget they existed. (rip Aero III) 

I would recommend that everyone give this game a try, and I would recommend to the developers to make the game easier to buy.

"I wasn't a big fan of the games play style, I find the use of cool down mechanics and the restriction of what a person/player can and can't do. In a game like I think a free roam attitude and the ability to dream about what comes next is important.

I will explain what I mean, I understand this is the game gimmic but for players to not be able to live out their fantasy of play an MMORPG that is god tier or of such. That you should be able to not have these cool down restrictions, a basic attack for example would be better utilized if the player could train this skill and based on that could attack faster, for a game to rely on armor and equipment to judge and test your skill rather than dedication and commitment leaves and empty or wanting for something more. For that reason I gave up on the game, I uninstalled I ended my subscription and moved on to better horizons, I understand many love this game and the memories they made but for me this isn't what I imagined.

Games are supposed to be fun they should be a bunch a button presses a robot could do, I feel like a dead corpse playing this game, I have no control over what do and when I do I am forced to follow META combos and listen to the cool down timers, I hate this, I think a game based on being able to live out your dreams should a nice system where you as the player can dump blood, sweat and tears into it and get better, but that's not how any of these games WoW included.

"Wow... What to say about this game? Well, I guess WoW is a good place to start, actually! As a long-time player of World of Warcraft, I can honestly say that I haven't felt this way playing an MMO in years! Before all of the instancing and cross-server stuff, the game had a sense of community, and upon playing, you'd bump into you'd met before. It was such a cool feeling to have a reputation amid the community outside your friend group.

Blizzard used to be that cool company I would always bet on; they made cool games, and they had that confident attitude to innovate and produce quality products. I guess you already know that, though. 

But this isn't about WoW. Honestly, my experience with XIV has been partly in lamenting the loss of the game I once loved. It's like an old friend that you have memories with. It's become a toxic relationship, and I can no longer support the company that makes the game. It's a hollow shell of what it once was, and I think the exodus to XIV will be a good thing for Blizzard. They're really going to have to step up if they want their fans back. 

The community in XIV reminds me of the times I had with WoW in the past, and it allows me to experience an adventure for the first time. The community morale is amazing, and the sense of belonging I get while interacting with people is a joy. The fact that the community loves their developers and vice versa really stood in stark contrast to the Stockholm syndrome I had for WoW. For years, I thought ""all I have to do is wait for the next expansion. It's gonna be great"". Final Fantasy has shown me that greatness doesn't come from engagement metrics or data sets-- it's about having developers who are active listeners and actually play the game they make. I've wasted at least 15 hours so far in the Golden Saucer alone, and to what end? Because it's fun! That's what gaming should be.

"Well, it took 17 hours to download. That's really my ISP's fault I suppose. 1 hour to even create a character. Then an entire days wait until I could actually get on the server my friend plays on. The waiting wasn't what got this a negative review, although all of those things were extremely frustrating.

I'm unsure if this picks up and you're more than a f*cking mail man. But I did like 20 quests. Got half way through level 7. Every single one is ""talk to X"", ""Go get X"", ""Deliver X to X"" jfc, if I wanted to deliver stuff I'd have started a career at USPS, UPS, or FedEx.

You need a subscription after your first 30 days. But in reality they should be paying you for wasting your time opening the game.

The fighting system is very similar to WoW. You can pretty much button mash and kill stuff. 

The UI is the equivalent of a hoarder. In fact on the show Hoarders I have seen people's houses less cluttered.

The story, quests, and NPC's are boring. In fact I haven't even read anything past the first conversation with that guy at the beginning on the boat. I literally skip everything said. Not that it even matters. Because your objectives are in a list on the side of the hoarder UI that if you click will show you where to go on the map.

It's almost like they said how can we take WoW & Guild Wars 2, combine them together and create a worse Dauntless.

And I know it won't be too long before some brand loyalty dipsh*t to Square Enix and this franchise shows up here and comments trying to defend this POS. But you can take Final Fantasy XIV and shove it straight up your @ss sideways. This series stopped being good at FF7. Everything past that has been a giant crap shoot. You know it, I know it, and everyone knows it.

This was an absolutely terrible experience. And I can't even refund this trash. I will never buy a Square Enix game ever again. Eating lead and ripping my eyeballs out with a claw hammer is more appealing than ever opening this again. 

I could talk sh*t about this game all day. The one positive is it cured my insomnia. Other than that NOTHING is good about this.",2021/07/21,2,6,0.279360324144363403,0

As we have seen,  MMOs can lose their focus and turn into the villains they write and design. BUT its also possible for a bad MMO to turn into a great MMO(AND IT IS TURNING INTO A GREAT MMO) through Dev dedication only seen comparably in early blizzard days(ear to the ground production LISTENING TO YOU). I cant stand by blizz and the monster theyve become, at this moment im warlock in TBC with 4 piece void walker and spellstrike pants. I'm a god. Ive played every expansion in wow throughout and have every before the curve achievement. This game is incredible.I know i said like every other person in here telling you quit wow and this is a wow killer. Its not. This is just a really great MMO and I promise you, you'll fall in love with story and community. Nothing but positive vibes and i promise you that you can ask any question and not get barrens chatted

First of all the graphics are ok. They look crisp and the visuals and animations are great.

"I love this game. I know a lot of people are going to look at it and go 'ew, weaboo trash', but honestly you're missing out. The base game's storyline is decent, with a lengthy endgame questline before the first expansion, but after that I was blown away. The series of cinematics in between were really more like a movie, and a really good one at that. The graphics, the musical scores, the storytelling-I couldn't get enough of it. Top that with being able to be every class with just one character (if you're up for the level grinding required) and I honestly can't find any reason to not make this my mmo of choice. If I had one negative thing to say about this mmo it's that there's a botting problem in certain questzones, and it's hard to report since you need the person's names (which are usually always a random string of letters).

"This is the greatest MMORPG of all time. I've put in about 600 hours as of writing this review, and I still have not beat the MSQ. There is just so much to do. It improves on everything classic WoW did from 2004-2009. It also has devs who are very community oriented, and the player community is great.

The story is the best story you'll play in an MMORPG, and is definitely up there with some of the great RPG stories. Be aware that A Realm Reborn (the base game) is mostly story set up, but that set up really pays off in the expansions.

The gameplay is pretty great. It's a standard hotkey button MMO. Where it really shines is in all the jobs. Each job has their own unique play style to fill their role.

"I had quit the game myself two times in 2015 and 2018. I never got past ARR because somewhere along the way i found the game boring. I gave it a good chance, around 40 hours on both characters and read the dialogue to get into the lore, but i found the game to being boring around level 30-40. 

I recently saw the game beginning to get traction again and re-tried the game with the 2 weeks free gametime, and i must say I'm enjoying the game a lot more now. At the end of ARR the story became a lot more interesting, and i have been storming through the content with 80+ hours this week alone.

My word of advice for new players is to finish the Main Story Quests that are available in the free trial which includes Heavensward to get an opinion of the game, if you still don't find it interesting then the game is not for you.

Achievements used to give you mounts, minions, songs, etc etc (some really cool shit) but now all the cool shit is locked behind Mogstation which is pretty shit because it forces you not do to endgame shit (except raiding)

The games casual as fuck compaired to other good mmos, alot of people will throw around WoW but WoW actually has a huge open world to explore and quests that actually have a meaning... unlike the nier quests that make you run a dungeon with no mobs or nothing to even make it feel worth while..

PIck a tank base class, tell people 'hi its my first time here' in dungeons and enjoy the ride of everything there is

When you feel stuck, follow the quest chain that shows up in your top Left of screen and otherwise enjoy the ride of so many things to do

My crafters are higher level then my warrior tank is, i get sidetracked doing other stuff all day long and that sort of fun is what ive been chasing after for years in the gaming world

There's a reason it sold out digitally

P.S. buy it on steam and register it on mogstation (set country to Australia if you are Aussie, let it tell you you are in EU/PAL region for your square enix account or it wont work if you try the NA stuff there, dont worry you can still make characters on any of the world servers you like once you are in the game)
You need a VPN if you are on an Aussie ISP like Optus to download the game itself from the launcher to avoid download errors (dont waste time googling alternatives, trust me, i used Express VPN after a day of research and got through this pain point)
Endwalker wont give you all the previous expansions until it releases in november, so buy base game + shadowbringers + endwalker pre-order to get everything the game has atm
Hope that helps you get through the true Mythic Raid Boss, which is the SE Website to register/buy game",2021/07/20,0,0,0,0

"I am currently playing this on Square-Enix official launcher since I have lost my Steam ID. 

My first touch with FFXIV was back in 2015, I played ARR and Heavensward when it released. At that point, I liked the game but majority of my friends still played WoW. I started WoW back in 2005 when it came out and have been playing it on/off to BFA. Shadowlands made me not want to start the game and I was losing my hope for the MMO-genre. 

Few of my friends got me back into FFXIV and I'm hooked. The game is incredible how much alive it feels more than other MMO games. Community is very friendly compared to WoW which is toxic due to it's more competitive nature. The story of FFXIV how it became to be is absolutely incredible in the video game history. From a total flop and finance crisis to a successful game. 

Square-Enix has really nailed this game. It still gives the game a single player feel due to the heavy story but with the populated world of other players, you know you're not alone. Visually the game is stunning and still can run on a potato PC well. Music is stunning as always in Final Fantasy games and it's really diverse compared to other western MMO or eastern, such is the trademark of Final Fantasy series. FFXIV gameplay is your basic tab-targeting MMO but the combat is the key. Combo based abilities and your classic limit break is here, it's truly Final Fantasy. One of the best features = one character can play every class and profession. 

My few negatives is with the account management and how much players can be on a server at once, it's logical that it's limited but you're gonna queue every time you log in. Mogstation compared to Battle.net is a design nightmare. New players especially to MMO-genre can shit their pants how much stuff is there to do and feel overwhelmed pretty fast. My tip is to stick with the main story until you learn all the basics of the game, genre and how everything works. 

Overall, 9/10. I could write much more but I'm tired af. TRY IT OUT ATLEAST WITH THE SQUARE-ENIX OFFICIAL LAUNCHER! FROM STEAM YOU CAN'T GRAB THE 1-60 FREE TRIAL (IT'S UNLIMITED TIME TOO)! You can play ARR and Heavensward for FREE! That is hundreds of hours of content for FREE!

"This game is an amazing MMORPG. 

The skills look great and although the game seems a bit slow at first, once you start getting into higher levels 20+ then the game gets really fun and interesting at the same time. 

The challenge bosses give you in EXTREME modes and above are really a challenge but fun as well. 

But hands down one of my favorite parts is the community in the game. My experience with games like League of legends, Valorant, warzone. So many games just have the scummiest of people. And its so refreshing playing a game where people are so nice. I can chill and do so much cool but actually FUN stuff as well. All that together paired with an AMAZING story.

Even for me sometimes its hard due to how much dialogue but im getting more and more into the story and found myself naturally not skipping scenes simply because im curious what's going to happen next. It's watching and playing an anime at the same time but you're the main character. I've played 163 hours in the last 2 weeks. Honestly can't stop.

Actually has a story where YOU are the main character and not just the NPC's nameless best friend. Fishing, mining, cooking, and various other crafting for you to enjoy. Dungeons, Trials, and Raids are all unique with great soundtracks and cool mechanics. 

Game also has probably the most chill community out of all the MMO's i have ever played. Rarely meet someone who is toxic and players genuinely want to help you out whether it is learning a skill rotation or see you struggling on an open instance quest.

"So I'm a long time Final Fantasy fan and played almost all of them growing up. Since playing this I fully expected a WoW like experience which has degraded considerably since Legion and how wrong I was. FFXIV is easily the most fun I've had with an MMO since 2016 and the community is excellent, they've welcomed me with open arms and taken the time to teach mechanics to newbies. As the review shows at the time of writing I almost have 140 hours and I look forward to many more, so do yourself a favour and give it a try. The game may be a little bit slow in the first arc story-wise but by no means is it bad and Heavensward is one of the best experiences I've had not only in an MMO but in Final Fantasy as a whole.

"Never has an MMO sucked me in as hard as this game did. There is so much to do and the game itself is beautiful. I find myself doing absolutely nothing sometimes not because there is nothing to do, but because I just love taking in the scenery. There is a bunch of jobs and classes to play and the best part is you can do all of it on one character. Anyone who is like me and loves the feeling of just sheer progression will love this game because even playing minigames in the gold saucer for basically just casino money still feels like you're being productive. If you want to just make your character look cool and just focus glamour (aka The End Game) there is that to look forward to as well. I would spend 7+ hours doing nothing but crafting or gather and I would still not want to spend my time doing anything else because I genuinely have fun doing so. 20/10 would recommend to any and everyone.",2021/07/19,1,0,0.516574561595916748,0

"Preface: I played for just under 60 hours on a XP boosted server and reached level 62ish, and finished the Main Story Questline.

I really do not understand how people get into this game. Everyone touts the endgame as the best in the MMO segment, but to play any of the endgame content, you need to finish a truly MASSIVE list of quests known as the MSQ (more than that actually).

The MSQ is absolutely dreadful. It's a solid 50-60 hours of non stop dialogue quests that run you back and forth across large zones. There were entire days (6+ hours) I would play, and not see an ounce of combat in any of the quests I had done. It was ""run here, talk to this person, run there, talk to that person,"" for hours on end. So I trudged through it all, finished the MSQ, only to find out that the ""good"" content doesn't start until you do another 80+ of the same garbage quests.

The class design in this game seems pretty good, (again I only played to around level 60) but the LEVELLING process is terrible. You will spend the first 30 hours of gameplay pressing literally 2 buttons (I played rogue, then ninja, then samurai). I am not exaggerating one bit when I say my DPS rotation was 2 buttons for hours on end.

Maybe just one of these things in isolation would have been something I could suffer through, but when you're doing nothing but running from point A to point B so that you can listen to some contrived MMO story, AND the combat you occasionally get to experience is the most mindless thing you can imagine, I just found myself staring at the pre-heavensward pile of quests and calling it quits.",2021/07/19,3,2,0.448311150074005127,0
"Definitely one of the best MMORPGs and one of the best RPG story line ever created. This game has a massive community that is overwhelmingly supportive and helpful to new players. This really help retain the player base and later on, those new player pass on the supportive nature when they become veterans.

Regardless of which data center and world you choose, it will always going to feel ""alive"" and packed. There is high population throughout the 24 hours because people from different parts of the world can play on your selected world.

I highly suggest to give this game a try. A lot of people say that the base game (A Realm Reborn) is boring, but I find that statement to be very subjective. I thoroughly enjoy the quests and reading the dialogues of ARR and post-ARR. I love reading lore, so those extra quest lines are more like extra lore for me to enjoy.",2021/07/19,0,0,0,0

"What a ******* unbelievably brilliant game.
Played WoW for years (after it first came out) but stopped it because of toxic pick-up groups and trolls. Who needs the grief, I get enough of it at work. As a result I hated dungeons and instances. They almost always ended up with a fight with some arrogant dick who reckoned ""You're rotation is wrong"" or ""You need to be specced..."" etc.

What a pleasure FF 14 is by comparison. People are courteous and nice even if you totally screw up first attempt instances.

Really, really enjoying it. Can't wait to get back in the zone. Only criticism is I wish I'd heard of it three years ago",2021/07/19,0,0,0.47413790225982666,0

"Worst game I've ever seen in my life by far in comparison to every other game.

1. No ambient sound, no voice, no animal sounds, or anything... the world feels dead.
2. No real animation or anything in the environment, it's just reinforce the fact that the world is dead.
3. Amazon Delivery Simulator, basically it's just obnoxious amount of back and forth quests only to fill up your experience guage and that's it. I'd rather work at Amazon and make the money than working on a game and paying them money.
4. Community is toxic, incapable of coordinating or anything after dealing with AFK Tanks in various dungeons.
5. Story is just boring, it doesn't offer anything on the table that haven't been done by 50+ other games.

Overall, it feels like the standard for gaming was brought down to a new low with this game. I expected more from an MMO and it just sad that people have such a low standard and trash taste that they praised this game.",2021/07/18,5,9,0.316264748573303223,0

The community is by far one of the best ones that I have found online. Not like that's saying much since I come from League of Legends, though. The story, the character customization, the dungeons, the raids... everything in this game is well thought out and implemented (except for all of the fetch quests at the beginning of the game). There is something for everyone. Whether you are a roleplayer, a casual get on and hang out player, a grind everything till it is maxed out player, or a tryhard player that enjoys the hardest content, there is going to be something in this game for you.

"I’m still kind of new so I may be wrong about some of these. (30 hours on trial.) The game is great. The negatives are so minor that they don’t really matter, but I figured I’d mention them anyway.
Gathering - A+: perfect
Crafting - A-: could be better if the items said in the list of items how many you could make.
Questing - A-: A little too much running around delivering stuff from npc to npc.
Dungeons - A: The Random finder actually tells you how many people are ahead of you in the queue, but you have to open up the loot window whenever something drops.
Character - A+: Because of how leveling works, you only really need 1 character, since you can unlock multiple classes and professions on the same one. Customization seems really good, though I haven’t gotten into it that much, I see other people with cool, strange and funny costumes and mounts.
Materia - A+: Another thing that I haven’t really gotten too much into, but I like how the system works.
Cost - A+: They don’t ask a lot for the base game and the subscription fee is worth it. I haven’t gotten to the point where I need expansions yet, so I’m not sure if they’re worth it.
Average - A: 96/100

You can wipe 7 times but people still play, much different than wow, when you lose an arena match and the other guy quits. Wow fixed this by making dungeons very easy, and that's a big no no in an mmo, this way you reward the worst players. And Square is very fond of their product, banning any anti-social behavior.

"The game is ok at best. I'm a new player coming in after friends have recommended this to me as a game to pick up. For any new player coming in I fear they will also be discouraged to play the game further than the base game. Getting to the first expansion is a pain. Getting through 80 boring, useless quests can deter anyone from continuing this game further just like it did to me. If they removed those 80 quests it would help out with new people coming in and retaining players. Overall its an ok game, not worth the time spend trying to get into the expansions. 

Pros:
Very healthy population 
Nice spell animations 
Dungeons are actually engaging and fun

Cons:
Outdated combat system even for its year
Outdated player movement (better movement in n64 games)
Toxic community (gatekeepers are the worst here out of any other game I've played)
Lack of support from peers (a lot of things aren't explained to you and the community doesn't help when you ask)

Professions(Jobs) you can take them all.  Become a business conglomerate. If that is your thing.  I have been doing nothing but leveling my character and Her professions. they are all mostly 15 now, except Rogue.  The story of the Rogues was excellent.  

At this time I have not tried any pvp. I am still just discovering the world.  At about level 17 I got sent on a mission to the other kingdoms which opened up airship travel and the rest of the world.  There is much to explore. And many critters and jerks that need killin'.  

The amount of online help seems to be sparse or useless. So if you figure out something you asked for help with.  Answer yourself so that others can learn from you.

"Final Fantasy XIV is not a World of Warcraft killer
The first iteration of FFXIV almost killed the franchise as easily as the original Final Fantasy in the 1980’s saved Square. Square-Enix fixed it, and they did a great job. It is simple enough for most players but allows for hard core players as well.
Final Fantasy XIV is not a World of Warcraft killer, it is however a good alternative, some things are tedious as compared to World of Warcraft and Star Wars: The Old Republic, and some things are much less tedious as compared to WoW and SW:ToR. Compared to Guild Wars II, it is a massive improvement all around.
Combat isn’t as tedious as WoW and SW:ToR, because you can only do so much at any given time, and you don’t have a plethora of abilities to fill your quick bars with. There are just enough abilities to get you by in the world as you play and level.
Crafting is tedious as you must have a separate set of gear, and level the job as if it were a whole other class of character.  There are ways to do this efficiently I am sure, but I have been focused on getting at least one job finished to max level before going back and trying a crafting class again.
You do not have to make a new character every time you want to play a different class/job, you can do all jobs/classes on one character.
Overall, I find the game easy enough to play, and enough going on to keep me playing for several hours in one session. A WoW killer, it is not, but it is a great alternative.
I am not going to cover any negative aspects of the game, because from my experience so far, they are mainly my opinion, as I’m a long time WoW player, and a previous Ultima Online and MUD player. World of Warcraft brought the genre to the masses, if you had tried FFXIV prior to “A Realm Reborn” you may have waited a long time like I did to even bother trying it again. It is massively improved, the mantra for the current version of FFXIV is basically, if it is not fun, it does not belong in FFXIV, and it shows. The game is seriously awesome.
You can download the game and get a free starter account and try it out before you commit to buying, that is how I found out that it was much improved with “A Realm Reborn”. If you are on the fence about the purchase, go do that, you get a lot of content trying the game for free.

"I've played various MMORPG games before, namely Neverwinter, Runescape 2,3, OSRS, Vanilla WoW and every expansion except for Mists of Pandaria. 

I appreciate the fact that this game: 
1. Trial of FFXIV is generous 2. Amazing Animations for attacks and spells 3. Engaging combat 3. Good story 4. A friendly community and out of all of the MMOs, the least toxic (that I've personally observed). 5. Complex but rewarding crafting/gathering jobs 6. Surprisingly good graphics 7. Microtransactions are mostly cosmetics, and some store exclusive mounts or boosting to current expansion but the base game does give you a stock mount in the main story/scenario

I recommend this game to anyone who is up for an enjoyable and memorable experience. At the time of this review, I have about 66 hours logged and I started about a week ago now.",2021/07/17,0,0,0,0
"A story driven MMO with a ""Open world"" that basically has no more life than a lobby based multiplayer game. A Realm Reborn, or base game content, is basically fetch quest the game. 

If you like Final Fantasy, you'll get a kick out of it. If you can get past ARR content, Heavensward and Stormblood have slightly better stories with Shadowbringers being where the story actually get's good. 

But I repeat. This is a story driven MMO. You will spend just as much time, if not more, on the main storyline as you would a primary Final Fantasy game. Just with a LOT more filler. 


The only highlight I got out of this game, as a veteran to most modern and older MMOs, was raiding. Yes, this is one of those games where the actual fun content is end game. However there's so much story you simply CANNOT just skip it and be satisfied.",2021/07/17,0,0,0.434782594442367554,0

"Be prepared for hours of frustration just to log in. First, the authentication app made by square enix doesn't work, so be prepared to use something else, like the Microsoft authenticator. Then, I was able to play for about an hour and then went to play another game with a friend and was going to come back to it later. I went to log in again, after already spending half an hour just figuring out that the SE authenticator is complete shit, and it wouldn't let me because my game key had already been registered. Which it  had, I used it a couple hours prior when I was trying to figure out that the SE authenticator is worthless and I needed to use a third party app. And the worst part of all of it, I can't charge back the purchase because the thirty days of play time started ticking as soon as I used it and now I can't play because it entered the registration key on the launcher and not on the FFXIV launcher. You would think that the two would be able to communicate with each other. But, what else would you expect from a company that completely botched an Avengers game and left it without players a couple weeks after release. I would say be prepared to feel like ripping your hair out just trying to figure out how to get into the game. Overall, this shit is trash.",2021/07/17,0,0,0,0
" Edit: My little brother wrote this review while I was afk lol he loves this game, you'll love this game, play it.

After playing this game for 140 Hours, and that's only on my steam not my ps4. I can recommend this game to any body who is a fan of expansive stories and wonderful world building. However I do want to air out my few grievances with the game before blindly telling you to consume this product.
   This game Is long, especially the prologue, I would say within the first 10-25 hours is the most dragging part especially for new players. However to contrast that the world you are put into is an wonderful and amazing place that keeps your attention along with the fun interactive gameplay. My next gripe with the game is the lack of voice acting in the beginning. The exposition is the most important part of any game, this is where we are exposed to the whole game, this is where we meet characters that we should care about, this is the deciding factor on whether or not you want to play the game. Without voice acting there a disconnect from player to game, this caused me to just skip through any unvoiced acted part in the prologue, As I have issues with reading any on screen text for any extended amount of time. Besides that I would fully recommend this game based of everything else from the crafting to the combat.

"For everyone who's having a problem activating a key and/or using Steam to start up Final Fantasy:

This is a problem that persists because for some idiotic reason Square Enix insists on using the absolute garbage that is Mogstation and also refuses to somehow merge an SE-account with a Steam account or vice versa.

The solution for wanting to start the game from Steam if you have a primary SE-account for FFXIV is to download Steamedit and use it to remove the -issteam from the game's startup process. You can of course also use the official launcher, although I'm not sure doing that solves the problem (please let me know if it does). 

The only downside to having to use Steamedit is that you have to re-apply this bandaid every time Steam updates or you get the same error stating that there's no active subscription.

JUST BE CAREFUL! If you have a primary STEAM account on which you purchased and activated FF, you can only buy and use STEAM codes on Mogstation. If you have a primary SQUARE ENIX account on which you purchased and/or activated FF, you can only buy and use SQUARE ENIX codes on Mogstation. You can NEVER redeem a product code on Steam; it will NOT work.

Other than that: I highly recommend the game for anyone searching for a (new) MMO to call home, whether you're a disillusioned WoW-player or a player looking for a very community-friendly and engaging MMO. The system of being able to essentially playing every class (job) the game has to offer on ONE character is really good and the professions start out relatively simple, but can quickly evolve into a very deep dive into other professions to max them. The story, as said, is really good and, well, there's so much other stuff that's a step up from WoW - my previous MMO of choice - that it would make this post way too extensive to read quickly. Just give it a try, especially now with it being free until the second expansion. See you on Moogle!",2021/07/17,1,0,0.500171780586242676,0

"For those who are keen to jump into a large and involving MMORPG, I would recommend this game. I personally feel that the game is designed very well to cater to different types of players. 

It is a requirement to progress with the main story quest (MSQ) in order to unlock key features such as getting a mount, unlocking expansion content and unlocking dungeons/raids. This can be quite tedious with the fetch quests of the MSQ and if you are trying to catch up. However, the game delivers with its playstyle, dungeons, freedom of choice regarding jobs (and damn there is a lot of them), crafting and harvesting opportunities and overall openness. 

There is not a large emphasis on PVP so those that are looking at conquering people in the arena and being top dog, this is not perhaps for you. However, the next expansion is providing PVP content so who knows what that may look like in the future.

"Final Fantasy XIV is definitely worth all of the money. The developers care so much about the game and the player base, it is like having a comforting blanket wrapped around you to be apart of the community. Speaking of the community, it is one of the friendliest communities you will ever be apart of. While there are some sour apples, as there are in all communities, overall it is easy to make friends with all of the kind players! The combat itself is fun and allows for lots of creative freedom especially in higher levels. Personally I am a black mage, and an example of this would be Triple Cast. Triple cast will give you 3 spells with no cast time, and you can chose to do this wherever in your combo. Based on your decision, different parts of your combo will be faster. Sometimes I will use 3 fire 4's, but other times I will use it on my blizzard 3, blizzard 4, thunder 3 starting combo. Sorry for the tangent, though. I love black mage so much, it is such a fun and awesome class. Throwing explosions out onto monsters, what can be better????

"I have played many MMOs in my life starting with RuneScape shortly after it was released, to Ultima, RO, DAOC, Knight Online, FlyFF, WoW, you name it I most likely have tried it. There is a lot of great things about this game. First off, I had to drop the stigma of ""this game is trying to be WoW"". Play it from a fresh slate. It doesn't try to be WoW. It tries to be its own entity. If you like end game content of WoW this game has it. If you like the variety of RuneScape. This game has it. If you are looking for a game that has tons a features that encourage RP. This game has it. 

It has beautiful music that actually makes you want to play the game with the music on rather than listening to different music. 

It has challenging but fair end game content.

It has PvP (haven't done much due to having so much other content to do so wont say much about it). 

It has one of the best crafting/gathering systems I have came across in an MMO. 

Give it a shot, my review can go on and on about this game... Just go in with a fresh slate, don't compare it to any other MMO, and enjoy. Use the Active Help System a lot in the System menu button category. The game does a great job teaching people how to play. When you discover something new in the game it will add it to the Active Help rather than overloading the player with a bunch of information upon character creation.",2021/07/16,0,0,0,0

I made multiple requests to support and was bounced around to different regions with no support staff actually trying to help, even when given the error code, which appears EXTREMELY common when I searched it up online.

"Well, I have to admit, this is better than World of Warcraft in almost every way, except for the story.  But man is the story in Final Fantasy stupid.  It's predictable, very poorly written, and just plain terrible in parts. Also, largely pointless.  I'll get to complaining about the story in more detail  soon, but first a couple customization gripes.

Character customization is almost non existent.  Out of all the Japanese games I played like this, Final Fantasy has the worst character customization by far.  There is virtually nothing you can do to customize your character.  All you can really do is change the hair, and fully 3/4 of the hairstyles are really bad looking and the remaining ones hardly provide very many options.

Also, there is a very restrictive naming policy.  You have to give your character a first and last name, and there are many names that are just forbidden.  Most people's characters are named random fantasy garbage as a result.

However, my most severe complaint about Final Fantasy XIV, which is not something new, it happens in most games, is the following.

The story absolutely runs on a rail.  You have NO CONTROL over the story whatsoever.  You have NO CONTROL over your characters actions, decisions, or really ANYTHING your character does.  There were parts of the story where I was practically yelling at the screen because my character was doing things that were just so manifestly stupid, siding with factions that were so clearly villainous, falling for the most obvious and clumsily presented deceptions.  I find this so frustrating.  Had I any control over my characters decisions whatsoever, I would clearly not have done these incredibly stupid things and the story would've been quite different. 

I feel like I'm not participating in the story at all.  I have no control over my character.  I might as well be watching a movie rather than playing a game.  Video games offer an unparalleled opportunity to introduce interactivity with the viewer/player.  SquareEnix had the opportunity to actually allow the player some degree of control over the path of the story, some level of interaction, to create a truly memorable and unique experience.  But instead they went with the same old boring approach of giving the player no control over their characters actions and choices.

How many times have you player a video game where your character just stands there as events play out around them, fully capable of interacting with those events and changing the outcome, but your character just stands there like a moron and lets events unfold while doing nothing.  That's Final Fantasy in a nutshell.

Square could've done so much better and I thought they were supposed to be good at storytelling.

well, I'm still playing final fantasy, but only because even with the stupid story it's still a better game than world of warcraft, and has far more content than Phantasy Star Online 2 New Genesis but you would simply not believe how stupid and pointless the story is.

I just finished a major storyline, in which many characters died pointless unnecissary deaths largely due to bad writing, but at the end of the stroy nothing was resulved, and everything just returned to the same point it was at before the stroyline.  No resolution, no progression, just a colossal amount of wasted time that amounted to nothing.

Also, SPOILER ALLERT during the first part of realm reborn you spend a lot of time and effort collecting up six crystals from boss encounters to give you the power to do something unspecified.  Although you never actually do anything with the crystals and it seems like a worthless waste of time and a lazy excuse for 6 forced boss fights at the beginning of Hevensward, some random NPC that has no bearing on anything just turns your crystals off, basically nullifying everything you did in the previous storyline, then suprise suprise, you have to re-activate the six crystals with six more meaningless boss fights.  Total padding.

So much of the game is well programmed and better than WOW but the story is absolute garbage.  Literally one of the worst, laziest Final Fantasy stories ever.

Final Fantasy is a great MMO with a garbage story.",2021/07/16,0,0,0,0

"restore colors & details in FFXIV:

there's an easy way to get rid of the grey film that seems to hover over the whole game, if you use an nvidia card. I do not recommend reshade, as every reshade solutions also destroy details or change the look otherwise -- at least the ones I've seen do. 
nvidia's thingy needs no extra downloads or programs beyond GeForce experience, which everyone likely has anyway.

The solution I came up with cuts *nothing*, no detail in highlights or shadows or textures from the game, simply removes the grey film & blur that people complain about by ""it looks boring"" ""colors are way too muted"".
the result is that red looks like red again, green like green and so on. far away walls and objects are visible and sharp, not painted over with smush.

lights now seem to actually light things, walls, floor and so on.
it's quite a few shaders, but the result is really subtle otherwise (on my HDR screen at least) and does not change the 'look' beyond what I mentioned. 

no details are lost. I put quite a lot of trial and error into making it look as natural as possible compared to standard game greens/reds and so on.
I compared all three filters with normal game after all settings are done. 

try my values first as a whole, then make changes if it looks 'off' - I made notes where you may want to change stuff.

(if you use an nvidia card) be ingame!! --> hit alt-F3, choose new filter: 

1[Sharpen]:
Intensity 15%  (barely noticeable, but distant walls, roads retain wall textures even far away, while the standard game blurs it out and housing areas look a lot better since walls and non-nature floor profit a lot from this. more than 15% look visibly ""sharpened"" to me on my screen, and I dislike that look. 15% is not noticeably 'sharpened' since the game blurs so much for whatever reason and this counters it)
Ignore Film grain (did not see any change with any value) 50%

2[Brightness/Contrast]: 
Exposure +5   
Contrast +71 
Highlights -50 (MINUS! -- I have an extremely bright HDR screen and if you turn exposure and gamma up, you need to CRUSH highlights or the settings delete all detail from bright areas.
if this looks weird for you, look at a sunny day sky with clouds. change the value, until you see every cloud detail. I could go -70 and it'd still look ok, but -50 makes lamps pop more at night)
Shadows 0 
Gamma +6 (try this value first, and do not correct anything until you've changed all 3 shaders! 
this is likely screen dependent, but it helped me lighting up dark areas enough so I get the same details as standard game graphics)

3[Color]:
Tint Color  0
Tint Intensity 0
Temperature +2.5  
Vibrance +18.6     (anything more and the UI quickly turns into a candy shop and the game overall looks weird -- but this little bit helps dramatically to restore colors to normal)

at the end sharpen should be at place 1, brightness 2 and color 3rd. IT NEEDS TO BE IN THIS ORDER! 

the end result cost me about 10% fps - but the standard game bleakness is a deal breaker for me, so I don't care.

it's an amazing game. a real classic MMO with no bull5it. 

ironically, the biggest issue I have is that it looks bland, compared to the beautiful Black Desert Online, but unlike it, and so many MMOs nowadays, zero pay to win, no loot boxes or any modern crap pushed into games to fleece players dry.

it's basically a 1999 MMO with 'kind of' modern graphics, which is the best of both worlds. imho the best MMO today.",2021/07/16,0,0,0,0

"700 hours.
330 Days Subbed.
This is an honest review and the story of my time playing FFXIV (to those considering playing this game I hope this helps you :3) It's going to be long so there'll be a TLDR at the bottom. 

Background:
I've played a lot of MMOS since 2002 - Runescape (and all its iterations), WoW, Aion, Star Wars galaxies, Tera, EverQuest 2 and Everquest Online Adventures (PS2 EQ game), Rift, MU Online, Lineage 2, Guild Wars 1 and 2 and honestly? None of them can compare to the experience I've had playing FFXIV. 

Story Time:
  I first played FFXIV a few weeks before the launch of its first expansion Heavensward.  After much consideration on what class to play I rolled Lancer (Dragoon)  and upon logging in I thought the game was gorgeous, I also thought it was fun, however I felt rather bored after hitting level 14, I felt it being really really slow. Yet despite that I knew I'd come back some day and try again - so I did, right at the launch of Stormblood - the second expansion. 

  This time around I rolled a Pugilist (Monk) on a different server and my experience was significantly more positive. This time I got to level 40 and had experienced some of the early dungeons and Trial fights ( Group vs 1 Big Boss) and genuinely was excited to see the remaining content, however life had other plans and I once again stopped playing.

   Finally I had heard about Shadowbringers coming around and decided that once and for all I was going to get to the end game, so I rolled an Arcanist (Summoner/Scholar) two weeks before Shadowbringers and pre-ordered the expansion as well. When I had hit 50 and finished the base story, i couldn't wait to keep going, then I hit 60 and was in awe with the direction of the game, I finally hit 70 and capped out as Shadowbringers launched and was so excited to begin the journey to 80. It never felt like a grind but more like a progressive journey. Before the first week was over, I had dinged 80 and begun my journey into the end game. Raiding in games like WoW is a mentally daunting task, in FFXIV however it's not. Difficult? Yes at times, but never disheartening. No matter how difficult the content gets, it ends up being fun, its fun to get good. Yet despite all the conquests you may have doing high tier content, you never feel like a sweaty try hard. I attribute this to the community largely and the way the game handles this content. It's a game, not a lifestyle, not a second job, but something to log on to and have fun; with strangers, friends, friends of friends and just enjoy your time online. Which is honestly not something you always hear about other big MMOs. To date I have dinged Max level on 2 Characters (one which I made to play with a friend) and I can't wait to ding max level again when Endwalker comes out in November. 

Now review time!

Review: FFXIV is arguably the best MMO on the market at the current moment. Not only does it look fantastic, it plays solid and every class feels just different enough. Is the combat groundbreaking? No, not exactly, however it's rather smooth and is tailored well to suit players of all different skill levels. One of the game's greatest strengths however is its ability to have old content, still feel relevant. Even if you ding max level, doing a level 50 Raid is still very much so something that you will do and can do. 

 The Vanilla game content starts out rather slow, and quite honestly while just fun enough, isn't world shattering in nature. It doesn't really help set the game apart from other fantasy MMOs or games but.....that's okay. As you progress to 50 it progressively gets better, and you start to better understand what the game is trying to achieve. If i had to give the Vanilla content a rating I'd give it a solid 7.5/10. No higher or lower.

  Then we get to Heavensward. This is the expansion where the game began to realise what it wanted to be. A  game with a an intriguing (yet sometimes  VERY cliche) fantasy story, with grandiose and meaningful encounters while helping each player discover their play style. Simply put it took everything that made the Vanilla game good enough to play and made it better. This is also where the current free trial ends, and is definitely an ideal way to find out if this is the game for you. Solid 9/10.

Stormblood's content however leaves a fair bit to be desired after the titanic entrance of Heavensward. While not bad, and still continuing that upwards trend of improving on what content made the game more enticing, this is where the questing gets to a lot of players. It's not bad, in fact the story content is rather good. However, the story quests in the expansion also tend to drag on or have rather difficult objectives that may make it feel more difficult for some classes to progress. The end game content for stormblood is fantastic, but its the journey there and the hiccups along the way that make this a bit of a rougher expansion to get through than the others that have been released. Tough to give it a score but I'd say a 6.5 or 7/10  summarises stormblood rather well.

 FInally Shadowbringers, this is THE expansion. This is the expansion that made FFXIV the titan it is today. Story wise it introduces one of the primary antagonists of not just this game but even among other FF games and fantasy setting games as well. The encounters here will also just blow your mind. The scale of some of the boss fights makes you truly feel like you're accomplishing some grandiose task and that you really are the hero of the game. I don't think I could put into words what Shadowbringers truly accomplishes, as the only way to understand is to experience the content of the expansion. While some slightly annoying trends from Stormblood return, ultimately this is what I would consider the perfect expansion for FFXIV. 10/10. 
 
TLDR This game is nearly perfect, it has its issues however none of them are truly a problem. In my mind this is the true definition of a Modern MMO, where modern features and classic player interaction meet. With some of the best content in any MMO, that never feels stale and feels relevant at all points of the game for one reason or another. While questing can sometimes be sluggish, the game is ultimately well paced and does not impose barriers on progression to any who choose to play this game. The encounters in this game are fun, grandiose and well thought out, without being overly imposing while also having difficulty scaling that will appeal to players of all skill levels.

If you think anything written here makes you want to play FFXIV, give the trial (free to level 60) a try now before buying it (as the retail version of the game CANNOT be played with a free account) and experience Eorzea yourself.",2021/07/16,2,0,0.528977632522583008,0

The fact that I got to play for free until lvl 60 was the best to see if I truly would love the game. It was cheap to get the expansions and now it is only $13 a month, which is PERFECT! For anyone looking for a new RPG, FFXIV is what you are looking for. You will be addicted haha.

But trust me, getting through the initial slog is worth it. It's so, so worth it. There's an amazing game hidden behind the first -teen hours. Dungeons get much more hardcore. Story gets much more interesting. Fantastic crafting and gathering systems. There's a legitimately fun casino-like location. Collectable mounts, minions, haircuts, armor appearances, you name it.

The one thing that doesn't really change throughout the game, sadly, is the omnipresence of fetchquests. Quest design is probably the only actual gripe I have for this game. That being said, while there indeed are many fetchquests in FF14, they also present a ridiculous number of interesting side stories to tell.

Amazing, and a very well-made game despite some flaws.",2021/07/16,2,0,0.533373475074768066,0

"***Will be updated with each completed expansion***
Currently as of finishing the Heavensward expansion, (with much personal detouring) at 410 hours:
TLDR; 
Gameplay - 8,5/10
Story - (ARR) 8/10, (HW) 10/10
Graphics (Visuals, scenarios, cinematics and atmosphere) - 9/10
Music - (ARR) 8.5/10, (HW) 9.5/10
Servers - Never had a connectivity issue, even on foreign data centers
""Like WoW and Final Fantasy XII had a love child."" ""Even though I didn't enjoy WoW.""
/TLDR;

Disclaimer: I owned the full game from the start, I did not at any point try any of the free trials, though I am familiar with the given content within it.

I wouldn't call myself a patient gamer. Patient person? Sure. Gamer? Not as much. That isn't to say I don't like a good grind in a game, but I'm not one to want a game to exclusively be a grind.

Final Fantasy XIV is a very long, deep and rich experience. In terms of gameplay mechanics, I would definitely say it is closer to WoW or other MMOs than it is to most other games. It right off the bat gave me a feel of ""if WoW and Final Fantasy XII had a love child"". Though I feel I should mention that while I did briefly play WoW, I however did not enjoy it. The thing I found that remedied that in FFXIV was the fact that Square Enix has done a wonderful job tweaking this game to feel very much like a Final Fantasy game, despite it being an MMO. 

As I mentioned before, the world is very rich in both diversity and atmosphere. The game tailors very heavily toward the RPG fantasy styles of Japanese media, while meshing them seamlessly into iconic predefined FF subsets. While doing this, it gets very deep into the characters that drive the politics of the game, showing deep development of said characters. The pre-Heavensward main story line is a slow building plot, as there are so many different future events they are laying the groundwork on, as well as an entire index of different important characters they want you to feel familiarized with regardless of your starting region. If this doesn't turn you away entirely like it didn't for me, then you may find enjoyment taking a break from the story when you start to feel burnt out from it, stop and do some dungeons, or crafting, mining, maybe play some Triple Triad or Chocobo races. When you've completed A Realm Reborn, you will understand what I mean on this. 

Heavensward is truly and without a doubt a masterpiece. It is heartfelt, beautiful and the writing of this segment of the game cannot be done justice through my words. It is free content now, so I really do hope this encourages a new wave of people to enjoy it. It will be an instant boon for some people to know it centralizes around Castles, Dragons, atmospheric nods to King Arthurian fables, and tearing your heart out of your chest and wounding it emotionally.

I feel I shouldn't press too deep into mechanics or story explanations, as with so much of the game being a part of the Free Trial, you have more than enough available to you to be able to comfortably find your answer. If upon testing the waters it feels like it may be your type of game, then I recommend you continue playing because it probably won't be. If however it feels like nothing you would remotely enjoy, you just as well will have your answer pretty quickly. Also worth mentioning that there are large communities within certain data centers that enjoy Role-playing. I didn't start my file on one of those, so I have not personally been exposed to it, but the community has seemed very welcoming and wholesome.

After 5 hours of play I'm already almost level 16 and I just keep getting quest after quest and I always get off on an alternate tangent than the main quest. I think ive done maybe four main quests and the rest have been side quests. I'm literally just in the very first area and already cresting level 20. It's insane and but it feels like your accomplishing alot even if it is just busy work. Im gonna continue to play this game. So yes I highly suggest playing this game.

"If you are a gamer looking to play an MMO RPG to invest time in and love the rewards you get out of it this is the game you have been looking for! I got bored of WOW and other mmo's so quickly that I was lost for real. I am telling you, the ""boring"" part everyone keeps saying that the beginning is slow must have never played WOW. The first 10 hours I have been stuck to my screen, never feeling lost or overwhelmed one bit! There are so many mission types to fill your busy schedule with! I HATE doing meaningless boring side quests for XP but in FF14 I NEVER have to do a side quest to continue the story. What really turned me away from WOW and other MMO's is having such a long list of chores to do and not knowing what to do first. In finally fantasy you have very clear distinctions between different mission types and how important they are to continue your story! I have literally not stopped playing this since I bought it and I have to make this review so if someone like me is still wary of what to do and they are lost, I am telling you to buy this right now! The hardest part of this was making the account and logging in, which you have to go to a website to put it in steam code given to you and then you can activate your 30 day trial. It is a HUGE pain and I almost gave up playing this just from that but i figured it out and you can to. It is 100% worth it and it deserves all the praise it is getting. I can not wait to make more characters and get to the end game. If it is twice as good as the beginning like everyone says then I won't be going to work for a long time!

"Without falling into the trap of comparing it to other MMOs, Final fantasy XIV is a great game overall. Many people point it out, and it is true to an extent, but the beginning of the game is slow to start. Maybe not as bad as others might make it out to be, but it still feels slow, especially the nearer you get to the first expansion (Heavensward). However as soon as you reach it, it only goes upwards from there.
The story becomes extremely engrossing and if you get even a little invested in it, the game will trample on your emotions in every way possible.
The gameplay feels very slow in the beginning, but as you level up and unlock more and more skills, your rotations become more fleshed out, and it works out very well, it just allows you to learn gradually how to play.
The world looks very good, and the later expansions look even better, as the limitations the devs had get removed (""must support PS3"", etc.)
The community is, overall, the nicest I've personally ever seen in any MMO I've ever played. Yes, there is still a toxic presence in there somewhere, but it's very small. In my 3.5k+ hours of gameplay, I've seen less than a dozen toxic players. The vast majority are friendly, and will gladly answer any gameplay question anyone has.

And with the free trial, it gives you a massive insight on the game itself, and whether you'll like it or not.

If you're even remotely considering trying the game out, I would say: do it. You have nothing to lose except a few hours of your time, and so much to gain if you end up liking the game.",2021/07/15,0,0,0,0

"Don't really want to make this too long winded so here we go.

Pros:  
-Game is basically a love letter to Final Fantasy fans.  Its got some fanservice for everyone, and a lot of fanservice for long time fans.
-The game has a killer soundtrack.
-The game is very player friendly.  Its got hundreds of hours of content for players of all kinds, from the most casual to the most hardcore to those that only care about wearing thematic outfits.
-The game actually has a pretty good story, which you would think is weird for an MMO, but is one of the core features.
-All classes can be levelled on a single character, which gives tons of versatility and options.

Cons:
-The game can feel like it drags at times.  This is especially true at lower levels.  This applies to both the gameplay, which is extremely simple at lower levels, and the story, which takes a while to get going.
-Instanced zones can be a bit jarring.  The expac areas are very large, generally speaking, so its less of an issue with them, but still something that might feel weird coming from more seamless MMOs.
-The combat has a fairly long innate CD to abilities.  Some classes play much faster than others, but this can feel very slow, especially early on.

Overall though, this is a very good game and a great value even for a subscription based experience.  You get hundreds of hours of game that respects your time.  Hard not to recommend it.",2021/07/15,0,0,0,0

"[I am posting this review after 100 hours of gameplay as both a fan of the FF series, and as a former WoW player. Now, these are my personal observations, experiences, and opinions, so bear in mind your mileage may vary. I had originally started my journey in this game as a trial player, and on patch 5.3]

FFXIV (ShB) is what I wished WoW could/should/would have been. A game where ONE character is all you need to play ALL the ""classes"" and ""professions"" in the game (aka jobs);  A game with a reasonably friendly and helpful community (compared to the elitist ones I've experienced in WoW), a game where it takes me no longer than 10mins to find a pick-up-group to do some ancient dungeon I've never done before; where public quests (FATES) are spaced about strategically and where the popular ones would also usually have fellow players participating in too. 

The level sync feature for FATES, scenarios, dungeons, raids, and certain quests is a well thought of function that makes progression in the game reasonable, with the optional feature of adjusting difficulty in the case of failing scenarios a very beginner/casual-gamer friendly one. 

The graphics are generally beautiful (with some caveats, but the game engine is indeed old, and the developers will be addressing this in an update)--the cutscenes fantastic. The voiceovers for all the major characters are well done for both English and Japanese (I can't say for the other languages available because I've never played in them). 

There are tons of things you can do in this game, and in fact, you could just play a trial account and max out all the classes/professions (jobs) to the current trial max level of 60 for FREE considering the trial's not time limited and this includes the base game A Realm Reborn and the awesome first expansion, Heavensward. You just have certain restrictions though.

For raiders and those that like beating a good challenge, the difficulty is well tuned and balanced, and no raid boss is too difficult to beat, as long as you get used to your job's role and your rotations. As with any MMORPG, playing as a tank or healer will give you better rewards and queue priority in the sense that you don't have to wait long for a group.

Also, if you are into dressing up your character(s), there is a huge in-game community dedicated to this. And this is also why you'll notice some Level 1 gear fetching ridiculous prices on the Marketplace (""auction house""). Glamour is all the rage for some players whom you can find group emoting and dancing in Limsa Lominsa on weekends.

All in all, if you enjoy a good narrative, even as a player new to the Final Fantasy universe, you will find the story engaging if not intriguing. Do note that if you're playing all the way from the start, it's gonna be a looooooong ride, even when just playing the main story quests alone.

TLDR;

Positives:
- Final Fantasy Universe
- Great narrative
- Awesome cinematics
- Fun classes to play
- Fantastic music and sound effects
- Helpful and friendly community
- Fully customizable Interface
- Perpetual Free Trial (up till first expansion)
- Game director regularly provides updates on the game and its development
- CHOCOBOS AS MOUNTS AND COMBAT PETS (for when you’re solo)!!!!!!

Negatives:
-	Certain graphics show the engine’s age, ground textures especially (but this will be addressed in a future patch. Keep in mind this game is 8 years old) 
-	Clunky animations for some jobs (Machinists need more love lol)
-	The fully customizable interface can actually be very overwhelming for new players
-	No on-screen waypoint/pathing system for quests (but you get used to using your map after a while)
-	Capital cities can lag bad on weekends if there are many players online",2021/07/15,0,0,0,0

"This was a tough one, because I think the game itself is a pretty good one...for a single player game. This game is better than most single player games but here's the thing, I'm paying for an MMORPG, and this game lacks in the MMO dept. The open world is soooo boring because the game tries so hard to streamline you into end game, even though there's a plethora of content to get through. When I played, I was like 15 levels ahead of the MSQ the entire way through, and I literally ONLY did the MSQ. The players are cool, however some of them are very....strange, however I'll take that over the cancer that is WoW. 
Raids and dungeon mechanics are super gimmicky. While this is a personal preference, I can't stand games that give you a clear insight to what the mob is about to do. Have you ever heard a raid leader in FFXIV? They're super quiet during the fight...because they have nothing to call out because it's already on the screen.

"I'll start with this: The Game is fun.

Im not much of a MMO player, i've heard about this game while watching Asmongold, sure i knew it existed but never cared, i was always a Gw2 player if anyone mentioned your favorite MMO. The decision to start play it was really spontaneous i tried the Trial version to find out if it can hook me in, and then i bought the game on steam discount. But that's for the useless story about what made me give it a try.

The Final Fantasy game gives us a unique opportunity to use one character for everything that mean you can play any class/job on one character, if you start with something that didn't fell under your likes, you can swap to different one, without remaking character. This system is surely player friendly, not many may like it, cause i personally don't think that my bulky male human would fit the role of Rogue or mage, so i'd rather try it on female gender alt, but making an alt is really tiresome since you are made to push throught the story yet again.

Ah yes the story, i'll be plain here ARR (A realm reborn) Story is boring, tiresome and exausting, at least most of it, i'd say 80%, people say they can hardly rework it to not damage origin story for expansions but i think thats a big bullshit. The story is extremly stretched, forcing you to do questionable things that make no sense at all. I'll give an example, you are send to kill a Titan, to get to the Titan you need a ship, and the guy in the port that is apparently one of the champions that beat this Titan before, refuses to let you in, with an argument that he don't think you're man for it. He refuses to be reasoned with, he was ofc informed before of your coming but he still refuses, and for the proving test he sends you to gaether food ingredients for banquet... around different nations... because ofc we have time for that...

In my honest opinion reworking story is possible and should be done to remove unnecessary ammount of diarrhea filled in for story to seem longer, it's pain to do it, and i've skipped most of the filler quest dialogues, i honestly didn't give a f*ck.

When you get past lv50 Msq game story starts to get interesting, hooking and you can finally hear voice acting!! YES for the more than 90% of base story line of 2.0 game you will hear maybe 3 cutscenes with voice acting!! im glad that coming from patch 2.1 and msq coming with it you finally get something to listen!
Also you get to enjoy some real challenging dungeon content and even raids, before you move on to the expansion story. If you can get past boring phase of ARR you will start to enjoy the game for real.

Community in this game is extremly nice and easy going, being new in the raids or dungeon people will hardly flame you, they will try to help you understand what you're doing wrong and help you get through it. It sure may change based on the wave of WoW players coming in and we all know they community is less friendly. 

For the classes i gotta say that the staring Tank classes are so boring that it should be a crime, i started playing as Maruder and i'll warn you that even when i hit lvl 50 i maybe had like 3 damaging abilities that you keep using 1 2 3, 1 2 3, 1 2 3, 1 2 3, 0 diversity it's boring really, i can uderstand tanking in raids, dungeons that your job is to make boss focus you so everyone else can spank him, but outside of dungeon playing him is so slow and so repetative, i switched to Samurai and i feel great.

Races, Human, Big Shark people, Cat People, Draco people, Litte sh*t loli or what ever this is, Furry Lion man, and Bunny girl with Lion being only male and bunny being only female to choose from, I choosed Human male for the sole reason that only Human male had full beard option, sadly only one i wish there would be more customization of your desired hero than few adjustment based on 1-2-3 options, i'd love to have sliders to truly customize my character and as boobs slider is a welcome future as a booty man i'd like butt slider too. But it's not bad it's does it job and apparently you can unlock more customization ingame(not paid store).


The game is really enjoyable and i surely recommend it, thought it has questionable moments and i wish i could influence some decisions that my character make. Game offers NG+ for ability to replay MSQ but if MSQ is so linear what's the reason to even do so. It has it flaws, it's not perfect but it's fun to play!

This review coming in before i even started first expansion, im at the point of patch 2.55 which is the last patch before first expansion came in and everyone says that i'll enjoy expansion more than ARR, i started to enjoy some aspect of ARR so i can't wait!

"Pros:
-A fantastic leveling experience, since the Main Story Quests (MSQ) will give enough xp to get to level 80 (the current level cap)
-17 different combat jobs (classes), each with its unique flavor and style, along with 3 gathering and 10 crafting classes (no, Blue Mage doesn't count, but it's a genius way to recycle content)
-gathering and crafting IS NOT USELESS!
-A really long but satisfying and well made story
-Doing anything will reward gil, xp, or endgame currency
-It's probably the most open ended endgame experience in a theme park mmo.  Raiding is still the way to go for the best gear, but there are alternate weapons and gearing processes to get caught up.  You don't even need to raid when you finish the MSQ, either.  You can build up a house, a free company (guild), farm glam in the Gold Saucer, craft, etc.  It really is up to you to decide what to do.
-gear in raiding tiers are not useless, either.
-All jobs (classes) on one character!  This means no alts!  do everything on 1 character, don't need more than that (unless you want to make more characters, then by all means)
-A healthy and generally welcoming community IN GAME (it's pretty nasty on twitter and reddit, but it is what it is)
-Job rotations are extremely satisfying to get correct, and playing the best that you can is encouraged.
-recycling of content is done extremely well and feels good to play.
-FFXIV does not gate gear behind secondary and tertiary systems, gear is extremely straightforward.  Once BiS, you are done with the raid tier or expansion.
-Varied amounts of content to do (MGP, Deep Dungeon, roulettes, RP'ing, housing, etc.)
-A collector's dream, with achievements, minions, mounts, glam to farm and collect.
-Beast tribes (reputations) are short and quick, but are also massively rewarding.
-openness and transparency of the developers.  They have something called ""Live Letter from the Producer"" in which the game producer, Yoshida (Yoshi-P) comes on a stream and explains exactly what will happen in the next content patch.  They also are open to taking in suggestions during certain QnA segments in which things people have asked for have been implemented.
-A non-obtrusive cash shop.  One does exist, but you have to purposefully go on the website to purchase anything.  There is nothing in the cash shop that offers any benefits and are mostly just cosmetic stuff.  Store mounts are not even an issue since I think a vast majority of mounts in game are equal to or look better than the ones in the cash shop.  Don't get addicted to fantasia bottles, but if you do... thanks for the next expansion pack!
-Any purchases made in the cash shop help support FFXIV's dev team directly.
-The game slowly introduces new mechanics in the MSQ, helping you understand the mechanics the game will throw at you in whatever content you decide to do (combat wise).  It's pretty neat as it starts off pretty basic. Shadowbringer base dungeons IMO were a step up in difficulty relative to previous expansion packs, but I might be thinking things.
-GM'S WILL TALK TO YOU WHEN YOU REPORT SOMEONE.  It takes a bit to respond but if someone is being rude and short, you can report them and they will be yoinked into GM jail.  A GM will contact you and talk to you about what happened.
-If you are a FF fan, this game is filled to the brim with references to older titles.  You might recognize bosses, enemies, and even some friendly NPC's.
-All of the jobs are balanced.  This means that any composition can clear anything.  There isn't really a meta, save for very niche content.  Otherwise, go ahead and play whatever.  Player skill is way more weighted than a job's inherent dps or abilities.

Cons:
-A long MSQ.  The reason this is both a pro and a con is if someone isn't into story, this isn't necessarily the right MMO.  Not to say they can't find enjoyment, just that they should maybe reconsider.
-Once you've done what you want to do, you may feel there's nothing left to do.  FFXIV isn't designed to hold your attention every day for hours.
-Glamour system is pretty jank.
-Housing.  Buying a house is an absolute hell hole and if you value your health, hang on until Endwalker, and get an apartment in the meantime.
-No Oceanic data center.  This is changing in Endwalker, so if you're new and in the OCE region, I'd suggest to hang on for that, and if you're not already attached to a community in your server, prep for that transfer.
-The mechanics are going to feel weird at first if you come from other MMO's.  Do not pay attention to enemy animations but the telegraphs.  your abilities will be animation locked.  When you press a button it doesn't necessarily do instant damage, either.
-PvP.  It has the perception of being bad, however it's not as smooth and responsive as some other MMO's out there.  I would not recommend playing this game solely for PvP.

Who is this game for?

In my opinion, if you are a player that wants a game that values your time and rewards you for spending time in it, FFXIV is the way to go.  If you're into story based games, this is a definite go.  If you just want to raid log, we do have ultimate fights in the game, however, I wouldn't say raiding is the primary focus of this game.  It's a small percentile of players that even attempt that difficulty.  If you're on the fence, try the free trial out!  Literally costs nothing except your time and patience in getting it set up though...

If you like to collect stuff, roleplay, achievement hunt, and challenge yourself, you're in the right place.  Welcome to Eorzea!",2021/07/13,3,0,0.533949375152587891,0

"I slept on this game for years, bought it on PS4 and PC years back but never actually played it. Finally did and WOW i was missing out. If you are looking to play a MMORPG and not a MMO person like me, this may just be the one that gets you into it. And trust me i tried ESO, Black Desert, Vindictus, and many others and never could get into them. This has me hooked. Friend years ago told me about FFXI and I wanted to play XIV ever since it came out due to him talking how good XI is. If you are reading this, DO IT. WORTH IT. Thanks Tabakas for talking about how good FFXI was. 

Also keep in mind majority of the time is the Launcher downloading the entire game, took me almost an entire day. But I have about 10 or so Hours in it so far and about to jump in right now. Also due to some WoW thing that happened FFXIV is getting LOTS of new Players as well. 

If you are a Final Fantasy Fan and been wondering and holding off if your skeptical, yes you knew it was coming, 

The FREE TRIAL to Lvl 60 and the entire first expansion is accessible without a paid sub so if you want to try it and like it before you pull the plug and buy it, sub and all, then this is the way to go. You cannot get this on Steam but googling FREE TRIAL FFXIV should be the first link. Highly HIGHLY recommend this game.",2021/07/13,1,0,0,0

"WoW refugee currently thoroughly enjoying the game. Been focusing on the main story line quest and it's compelling. The combat feels tantamount to other similar genre games with on-screen AoE indicators similar to Wildstar (for all 3 of you that played it). Definitely appreciate the transportation system in the game and how it is used for storytelling instead of gatekeeping. The game definitely feels like WoW was a huge influence (I mean that in a good way). Hard to tell as of yet if I foresee this being another game I can put thousands of hours into like WoW, or if that chapter in my life is already closed, but regardless, it has been a nice reprieve and I look forward to continuing the experience.",2021/07/13,0,0,0,0

"It's an MMO that nails the basics and essentials of the genre. It isn't trying to reinvent the wheel, because it knows the wheel has worked for millennia and doesn't need to add a new power scaling system every patch that becomes obsolete by the new power level gimmick the next patch brings. While it starts slow, combat really ramps up around level 60, as that's when most classes get their essential tools, and by level 80, each class feels completely fleshed out and realized. The problem is that until that point, some classes feel gutted without their core gimmicks, the Dancer when synced to level 50 loses access to the ability to select a dance partner, Dragoon doesn't get the Blood of the Dragon gauge until level 52 and cant use the 4th attack in its combo until level 56, Warrior isn't Warrior without Fell Cleave, etc. While it's nice that the game syncs your level and gear to old content, the loss of essential abilities makes clearing old content not as fun as the more recent content.

Speaking of content, there's a lot of it. Throughout the game's lengthy MSQ, you'll unlock dozens of dungeons and trials, and eventually 8-man raids and alliance raids. While I find ARR and the earlier HW content to be hit or miss, late HW and Stormblood onwards provides great high-level content. While the Raids and Trials you encounter throughout the campaign range from easy to a comfortable spicy, Extreme and Savage content are some of the most engaging, polished, and well designed challenges the MMO genre has to offer. While earlier content loses some of its edge due to scaling, if you utilize the minimum ilvl feature, the fight will be as challenging as it was when the content first launched. If you're worried that FFXIV is lacking in content that will cater to hardcore smelly gamers, the savage and ultimate raids will put you through the wringer.

But if you're not into uber-difficult content, and want an actual videogame with a story, FFXIV was made specifically for you. While ARR is overly verbose and the voice acting starts out amateurish, and the post-ARR questline is an arduous slog that picks up towards the end, the story really improves during Heavensward. While people have conflicting feelings regarding Stormblood, I found the story to be compelling and the themes of imperialism and colonialism to be handled very well, but it fumbles a bit when it comes to connecting the Doman and Ala Mhigan conflicts. As for Shadowbringers, Shadowbringers is INCREDIBLE. Everything you've heard about Shadowbringers is true, it is one of, if not the best stories ever told in an MMO, and stands shoulder-to-shoulder with other entries in the FF series. It will take you a very long time to get to the expansion, so take your time to enjoy (or try to enjoy, in the case of post-ARR) the content that precedes Shadowbringers, because there is a lot of foreshadowing and setup for twists and payoffs that land incredibly well if you've been paying attention.",2021/07/13,0,0,0,0

I gave up trying and am trying to play with a friend now... thing is I can't even log in. After 3 days of fighting with theirs and steams stupid systems (getting locked out because I had to use characters that didn't seem to work even though I copied and pasted from my old notepad) I was finally able to log in! Thing is it didn't have my purchased DLC... so another couple of days later I was able to get it working!

I have 26 days remaining and don't plan on re-upping afterwards. Heck I haven't even logged in yet. And the time I accumulated is from having the launcher open. Nothing like fudging those numbers for investors saying ""our players are on for ALL the hours."" Anyway wouldn't recommend, too much drama to just get in.

This game is paced in a way that's not too quick for someone like me who gets ripped and plays games, and slow enough to play with a more casual flow.

"Don't buy this Steam version if you already have a Square Enix account & had this game on a Windows version back from Beta or had a Free Trial account from a ways back. For some reason I ran into problems registering my Steam product keys version of the game to upgrade my Square Enix Windows version of the game to ""Regular"" or as in a ""Membership"" subscription of sorts, sending you to the Mog Station website of Square Enix online site to link your Steam account with your Square Enix account, which the service to do this process runs into an error code ""s3802"" telling you that you need to go through Steam support to resolve the issue.

But the Steam support for this specific issue seems scuffed and can't really help you it felt like. 

So for anyone planning to buy this game, if you already had this game tied to a Windows version of this game, just buy the game from the Square Enix website to save yourself the trouble, because Steam won't refund you for this headache they've trapped me in.

Otherwise if you're buying this game through Steam and setting up your Square Enix account through this process solely because you don't have a Square Enix account yet, you'll have less of an issue I'm sure.",2021/07/13,1,0,0.525862038135528564,0

"Best MMO I've played. Combat is simple and not too fancy but the map and the NPCs are detailed and full of life, and it really immerses you into the world of Eorzea. There is not a single hint of Pay for Convenience or Pay for Win elements in game. In fact, you can't even see the cosmetic shop in-game. The game UI is completely focused on giving you a good time enjoying the story. If you're the type who like to rush through the story just for the end game, this is not for you, because the first expansion can feel kinda slow.

"Here is my first week in Final Fantasy XIV.

Started as a Marauder in Limsa Lominsa, fell in love with the art, the city and the characters. Leveled up until I was able to become a Rogue. Fell in love with the Rogue's Guild. 

Started crafting. I was blown away by the depth of the crafting system. From gathering to actually crafting, it is amazing.

I managed to become a Ninja. Combat became amazing. Did a dungeon. The tank was really nervous. The veteran members helped me patiently. 

I returned to Gridania, found a group of bards playing Teenagers by My Chemical Romance in the most amazing and beautiful rendition of the song I've ever heard in a videogame. Everyone sat around them, clapping, cheering. Some others dancing.

I come from World of Warcraft after more than 10 years there. I come from a game that has become nothing but a hollow shell of what it used to be. Final Fantasy, on the other hand has soul, has a community, has people helping and interacting amongst each others.

"One of the greatest games ever made in my opinion. No MMO even comes close.
One thing you've probably already heard but should know before getting the game:
1. Enjoy heavily story based games, and don't mind a lot of reading. The main quest line up to the end of shadow bringers is the longest main story I've ever played in a game taking me ~230 hours with like 90% of that focused purely on doing the Main story quests. I am also told by many friends that I read very quickly so it may take slower readers longer. The story is the main focus of the game, it pervades every bit of content in the game.

I could go on and on about the game but honestly, if you don't mind the story part or enjoy that kind of thing and want to experience the MMO with the most alive world in the industry then I highly recommend this game.

Most people are nice and give really good feed back especially in dungeons. crafting is a bit heavy, but fun. Music is amazing! Hardest part is all the fetching and traveling to random areas...

"Before I dig into into this game let's start with the basics; This is not WoW or anything like WoW. This is a JRPG at its core with an online community slapped on top of it. Love it or hate it, with 10+ years of content with little to no legacy revamp (i.e what happened with WoW during Cata onwards) you will have a poor experience up til you reach current content, because you are essentially 10 years late to the party and will mostly be treated as such unless you play with ""like-minded"" people who probably are in the same boat as you or probably is one of those who find the gift wrapping more interesting than the content itself.

+ The music is really something else that in my 30 years of playing JRPGs really find hard to describe. And I still have a heavy bias towards Falcom Sound Team jdk.
+ The story once you get passed ARR. Although for you it might become a slog because as I mentioned you're probably quite late to the party.
+ The boss fights. There is nothing like it and probably never will be reused in our lifetimes.

+- Not really sure what I should put here. It really comes down to knowing what you're getting yourself into. I did thankfully play early ARR and then started playing during HW via Steam. But I have plenty of experience from other MMOs so it's not like I was going in blind. If anything I wish Steam had a middle-ground for recommending games. Buying a boost will only bring more problems, because as I've mentioned this game is heavily tied to its legacy content. Sure you can check out the story on youtube, but that's not really gonna help with anything else that goes on in the game. It's not like WoW or D3 which you can just pick up and play if you've played similar games before.

- Legacy content is what makes this quite the tragic experience because it plagues even current content and will do so for the rest of the journey due to this game being built upon another game among many other issues. And let's not even start with the anti-bot measurements that does nothing except griefs the active player.
- Your active gameplay is tied to server ticks which may or may not have you want to pull out your hair or teeth.
- The crafting system is one huge mini-game in itself and it does nothing to award you for playing it apart from wasting your time even more. So figure out the path you need to follow or use one of the friendlier guides/macros out there unless things have changed for the better.
- Playing as healer feels like a whack-a-mole unless you play with mouseover macros.
- It takes 3 clicks to buy items if it's a dupe or otherwise.
- It takes 2 clicks to sell items.
- You can't interact with anything when on a mount.
- Basic interaction with say doors sometimes needs a prompt (because potato reasons) and therefor you need to click twice.

In a TLDR sense you are essentially tasked in flying to another country to buy the same product you could find in a store near you because of potato logic. Wasting time for the sake of wasting time is one of the highlights in this game because wasting time = have sub for longer = profit. It's time-gating v.2.0 more or less. 

Now pair this with the gathering system which is bothersome AT BEST and you got a recipe for a doomsday cake and then some.

- Combat is is very similar in a way, except this time around it's pressing buttons for the sake of pressing buttons because the whole concept with bosses and the combat itself is DDR or Dance Dance Revolution. So think any rhythm game out there (if you've ever played any) and you got that figured out. Then it's all down to memorization and hope for the best. It becomes nothing but a choir after that, especially during higher or even easier content because one potato can ruin the entire fight. And as the saying goes; You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.

Premades is the key here for a pleasant experience. Or even people who know what they're doing at all.

---

So why do I keep coming back? More or less for the music and the story (so far) and hope anything of the above doesn't make me quit faster. I've already started so might as well finish the ride/book/checklist even if I don't like the majority of it one bit. 4-6 month a year is like the sweet spot if you ask me. 2-3 months for when the expansion comes out and leave the rest just before the next one hit so you can farm the best endgame gear before you rinse and repeat. Doing old content is a thing (i.e glam/mounts) but it's quite clunky because the game wasn't really designed around such an idea.

"I was hesitant at first: This game seemed super weeby, I was a bit turned off by catgirls and the little midget people (lala). But after trying to get back into WoW and realizing how bad retail had become, I decided to give it another try.

It's actually a lot of fun, I am enjoying even the early story-line (which is supposedly the worst!), quests and mechanics. I also like that I dont need an alt for every class. The writing is even really good, I wasn't expecting much based on my previous experiences with poorly translated JRPGs. The community seems pretty chill compared to WoW as well. I haven't gotten to end game but in dungeons if you mess up a mechanic people aren't like `KYS uninstall`. I suspect because many of us are 'new sprouts'.

My main complaints would be that it is clearly not optimized/written for PC: the anti-aliasing is kind of bad (there are tools you can use to fix that) and the menus/navigation feel a bit weird to navigate. Also: it would be nice to be able to be evil: You can't really be a Beastman/Empire, even the black mage types are essentially 'good'. So there is no real Horde/Alliance dichotomy (at least so far in the first 30 levels). But overall I'm having a lot of fun and nice to be exploring in a new world and not be rushed into some mediocre endgame grind.",2021/07/12,0,0,0,0

"The leveling experience is absolutely horrendous. 

Constant cutscenes, ton of leading into areas or just single room, main questline has a ton of instanced combat that arbitrarily limits your level and prevents you from using abilities u already unlocked, majority of the quests are just you walking around cities/zones talking to npc's.

Maybe if you really like the story then none of this matter to you, but if you are just looking to play the game then you are looking at 100+ hours of this, because you have to complete the main storyline.

Some of the dungeons seemed okay, combat isn't super responsive, but its decent. 

There are some other issues, like when u get a ress during an encounter there is a long delay after u press accept, not having any addons, so u better be happy with the default interface. Dps meter has to be done using a overlay.",2021/07/12,2,0,0.501792788505554199,0
"Finally reached the end of FFXIV: Shadowbringers main story after 2-300 hours, and all I can say is WOW, this game instantly gets catapulted into my top-3 games of ALL TIME!!!

Square Enix manage to deliver on the one thing that most MMO players crave, that Blizzard have neglected time and again, and that is building a real emotional connection between your character, your actions, the world you play in, the characters you play alongside, the plot, the art & music - it's all there, the complete MMO package, on an EPIC scale. 

Phat loot is a nice carrot to chase, but is not the main focus of this game. If you are sick and tired of the endless ilvl grind and time-gated story in WoW, and want something with a bit more substance, give this game a fair shot. Once you get through the first 50 hours or so, the story takes off like a rocketship, and you'll never look back.

"This is probably my favorite game of all time. I've played MMORPG's since around 2006, mostly jumping from F2P game to F2P game. I had never played a subscription based MMO like FFXIV before trying it mostly out of fear of the money being worth it. 

I very quickly learned that it was worth it, oftentimes i'd drop 60 dollars on a game that i'd play for 2 hours while final fantasy has given me over 4000 hours of enjoyment and there's always stuff to do.

It doesn't feel like a chore logging in, the game rewards you for time invested and doesn't make you feel like your progress is gonna disappear because of a patch or a dev deciding they wanted to nerf/rework something.

All the jobs/classes are extremely well balanced, none of them really feel like a standout of ""play this or you can't play the game"". It's just like... satisfying? The dev team genuinely cares about its community and feedback and I think because of that it's created a really great game that people will talk about until the end of time.

If you're hesitating to try it because of the sub fee and are a huge MMORPG fan I can't recommend it enough give it a chance I know the sub fee may seem irritating but think about the example I gave earlier, how many times have you spent money on other games and got no enjoyment out of it?

"(update:

So I talked to people in-game, looked more deeply into reddit and I will change the review from a negative to a positive. Though it was more a neutral if steam allowed that.

Endgame as a soloer consists of -
Deep dungeons
Triple triad
Mount collecting
Glamour (transmog from sounds of it)
Housing (as stated in review)
Relic collecting
Achievements
Running old content is actually a thing
Leveling every class (which takes a LONG LONG time)
Blue Mage is an actual 100% solo class (but limited in what content it can do)
Crafting/gathering
Economic stuff
Carnival (blue mage only? I think)
Exploration/sight log
Jumping puzzles are apparently a thing
And probably more

If you use a boost (which I did), you can still see a good portion of the story AND solo all the early story dungeons. Dunno later on if can do that, but that helps a lot

So...I'm a fool

-Old review will be left up down below-


Well, hopefully don't get too much hate for this. Especially since I'm a soloer in the MMO genre (which there are tons of soloers in the MMO genre outnumbering the old group only MMOers of old, tons of reasons however to play MMOs not singleplayer games which I generally don't like at all)...either way

I got this because popular streamer(s) and everyone moving to FFXIV from the MMO I was/am playing to this one. And...the other MMO is definitely by far better for the soloer. Though I wish there was a middle option for steam where its neither negative or positive, because it is a good MMO, but for any soloers out there, its definitely avoidable.

Groups are forced during story instances (this is skipped if you boost and can just then solo the story instances). Then endgame...yeah...there isn't really any endgame compared to the MMO I play. There is housing, by far the best feature (hard to get into but I got lucky and someone gave me 10 million and he was handing out money like crazy to everyone and I could afford a house). 

Sadly...

And the reason I am not going to play past what I have played, despite liking many parts of the game. This truly is a raid or die MMO. The endgame is just raiding and dungeons, that is it...and I guess housing but that isn't enough. Black desert online (that I kinda play but not my main MMO) has vastly more content and TONS to do though rather pay to win its biggest downfall and its dumb enhancing...either way, BDO offers a ton of content of all kinds outside of grinding. 

FFXIV offers...housing...and...raids/dungeons...really that is it. In my main MMO, you can go back to old content and take care of a farm or have an entire area to yourself to build up and offers tons of stuff. BDO the same though I know its more a sandbox than a themepark.

If there is a lot more to FFXIV than that at endgame, I'll delete this review and slap my self silly for looking like a fool. But from what I've asked my guild who has played past three months after moving from my main MMO, its really raids/dungeons and that is it. Maybe it could very well be how they play, but I don't really see much meaty content outside raids/dungeons for endgame from my attempts at googling either. 

If that truly is just endgame, its pretty disappointing. If that is wrong and what I was told was wrong, then well...again I guess I'm a fool.",2021/07/11,1,0,0.52173912525177002,17

"After playing several MMORPG's including (but not limited to): 
- Aion
- Rift
- World of Warcraft
- Defiance / Defiance 2050
- Star Wars: The Old Republic
- Warframe

I can say this is by far my favorite so far. Reasons below as to how it stacks up: 

Pros: 

- Only one character needed. Unlike every other MMO I've played, FF 14 only requires you to make one character for your account. Any character you create, can learn ALL classes and jobs. All DPS, Healer, Tank, Crafting, and Gathering are able to be learned by only one character. This is FANTASTIC because that means you don't have to waste time on multiple characters repeating hours upon hours of content, or paying for max level character tokens. One play through on one character is all that is needed. This alone will make it hard for me to switch back to any other MMO that doesn't follow this model.
- Graphics look nice. Despite being 8 years old and an MMO, the game holds up pretty well. 
- Story content: Overall I'd say this lands in positive side of things. While there are many themes and tropes that get repeated, the more optimistic tone that FF 14 takes with it's approach is a welcome change. In other MMO's when someone commits a crime, the enemy is typically portrayed as beyond redemption. FF 14 has a practice of offering a hand at redemption. Sometime it's taken by the enemy and good things follow, sometimes they attempt to stab you in the face and you have no choice but to kill them. But it's a nice change from immediately going straight to pitchforks and torches. 
- Leveling lower level classes is fast. The game provides an ""armory bonus"" to all other classes that aren't your highest level class. Ex: If you primarily play a paladin and you keep that as your highest level class, and reach level 80 (max level as of this review) and you switch to summoner, your summoner will gain +100% experience as that class not your highest level. Stacking this armory bonus with other bonuses such ones from your Free Company (guilds), promotional gear that provide XP bonus from wearing them, and other consumables makes leveling EASY.
- Each class feels unique. Early on many classes only have a 1 to 3 abilities that will spammed over and over AND OVER again. But as you level up, especially in the 45-60 range, you will get more unique skills and traits. The first expansion Heavensward will introduce new a class resource for you and keep you on your toes.
- Virtually no gold farmers and spammers bothering me. Despite a VERY generous free trail period, gold farms and spammers aren't prevalent in the game. The ones that do exist get reported and banned quickly. Square Enix makes a point to release stats of banned bot accounts nearly monthly. 

Cons: 

- Global Cooldown of 2.5 seconds. This is rather annoyting and took me time to get used. It can make combat feel a bit slow / sluggish at times  While you can equip gear to help decrease this a little bit, it's still a bit of an eye sore of the game in my opinion.",2021/07/11,3,0,0.563492059707641602,0

"I wish i would have used the free trial before i bought it, i wasted money on expansion.
The quest line is interesting, but if you wanna just do it fast and get to end-game (or at least unlock other cool classes), you have to finish the main story quests untill lvl 50, and after that AT LVL 50 you have to do 80 MORE quests, to unlock a certain city. I already played 35 hours to finish the first part of the main quest, because i bought this game especially to play Dark Knight. Right now i'm uninstalling it, i'm not wasting another 30 hours to unlock the class i want. And you can't progress otherwise, all the quests are lvl 50. A big waste of money, sadly i can't refund it, not even the expansion i didn't get to play :(",2021/07/11,0,0,0.440000027418136597,0

If you are looking for a wow style pvp mmo replacement this isn't it. If you love doing coop content and having a game to hang out with good people and good content then this is the game for you. FF14 is better described as an online story driven role playing game with a lot of MMO features. It does have PVP but it aint the best. It's fun but it's not as fleshed out as wow's pvp. The game its self is design entirely around the story. there are big over arching stories and smaller stories that drive you through the game. Leveling is not a massive chore like it is in wow. leveling in this game is really meant to get you to most enjoyable parts of the game which is the raids and dungeons. There is no pvp in the open world so you can't role up on a noob and grief them until they perma quit the game. No people in this game are some of the friendiesty people in gaming I have ever seen. If you need help all you gotta do is ask. There are the occasional a$$ hats but they get shut down pretty quick. This game is more about enjoying it WITH other people rather than against them.  There is one huge minus though. Trying to pay for stuff with real world money is the biggest paint in butt crack. If it's your first time trying to navigate purchases with this game it is super confusing and all kinds of discombobulated. After a while of suffering through the purgatory that is Square Enix's purchase protocols you will get used to it and be able to fin things much easier.  Now the early game is SUPER slow. I'm talkin yer gunna put in probably 40 hours before you start getting to the good stuff.  The first 40 hours or so until you get you main job classes is pretty much all tutorial... mostly enjoyable tutorial if you really dig story but still tutorial. Bottom line the game is pretty dang good with a few blehs that easily over looked.,2021/07/11,0,0,0,0

"I don't think this game actually wants you to play it. It puts so many barriers up between you and the game. 

I tried to take advantage of the free weeks by trying this game again after several years, and I don't know what my One Time Password is, which is a second password you need because one password isn't passwordy enough. what is it? Well, you can pay square enix another 15 bucks to get it, or you can download an app but you need a registration code from... somewhere.

So, I'll never get to play this game again. Yay! That's fine though, because this game sucks if I remember it right.

You need $60 to buy the game, then you need to pay $13 a month to keep playing the game you bought. Then on top of all that, you still need to pay for the latest expansion, so tack another $40 every 6 months. And then you need to pay another $15 to access your account with their one time password bullshit.

"If you enjoy engaging, cheoreographed and ultimately entertaining combat- do not buy this game. After spending enough time to get to 30 and then ask more and more people if things change- no. You are ultimately in a game of turret-standing cooldown management when moving is an option, but a non-essential one. 

If you enjoy buildcraft, stat management, or diversity in playstyle this is also, once again, not it. Having a build is a not a concept aside from obtaining best in slot gear for your class, so that you can play the exact same way as any other person playing your job. 

If you enjoy tanking- good news! You can be A tank. Not THE TANK. But A tank. Just like any other tank that is just as geared as you. Don't believe it?

Well you'll never know because there's no way to gauge how good you are as PvP is nonexistant. To quote a endgame twitch player ""even the bossfights are like memorizing a dance. Not anything to do with reacting to the situation or engaging playstyle. You just go through the motions to complete it"". 

FF14 has a ton of content and an engaging story once you're out of the starting zone. However, its unique bosses are only unique in styling, and only then some. The combat is Turret Attacks> Move from the Boss AoE>Continue Turret Attacks. 

On top of all of this, menus are a lot to learn, graphics are good but flat, and the color palatette involves no saturation. The best description I can offer is what twitch can offer. Just look at a photo/video of the game and that's the color palette. It can be to someone's taste, maybe. But if you're coming from a game with any color this is probably going to seem washed-out.

I'd recommend this game if you enjoy turret-style (standing in one spot) combat, the Final Fantasy Universe, and PvE.",2021/07/11,1,0,0.456191569566726685,0

"If you're looking for a tab targeting MMO with decent difficult raid content and plenty of content outside of raiding, FFXIV will scratch that itch and not force you to feel bad about not logging in for a day or two. There are no mandatory crazy systems you'll fall behind on if you miss a day.

The game starts off very slow, ARR is aged and can be very dull. They've reduced the quests to only the most important, which is great, but it does get dull after doing just the story quest over and over without need to pick up side quests. But once you get out of ARR, it is definitely true what they say, the game opens up and is awesome, and oh man Heavensward was an adventure.

The crafting system is the best in any of the 3 mmo's I've played(WoW, ESO, FFXIV), with each craft having their own skills/abilities, and a rotation as if you're DPSing a boss, to create the best piece of gear possible. Even the gathering professions have their own systems/abilities.

If you were a hardcore Mythic raider in WoW and are looking for some raid content with similar difficulty but don't want to grind your face off or log in every day, FFXIV will help you out. With only needing 8man teams, responsibility is higher, but getting a group together is easier. No trash in between bosses.

Give it a try, get through the slog of the first portion of the game, which I know sounds silly right? Shouldn't have to go through boring stuff to get to good stuff, but lets be fair here, the first portion of the game is from almost 10 years ago, and with the way FFXIV is structured around STORY, they can't just ditch the first portion of the game without you missing VITAL story pieces. They do offer story/level skips, but you'd be doing yourself a disservice. Stick it out, the game is very well done",2021/07/11,0,0,0,0

"Final Fantasy 14 is probably one of my favorite games of all time. It has anything you can want from a hotbar based mmo. While the content and classes are great, there just isn't quite enough content to fill a players belly once they are completely caught up, especially if they enjoy pvp or competitive pve (like mythic raiding or m+ in WoW). That isn't to say high end pve content doesn't exist, but there is only 12 savage bosses and 1-2 ultimates per expansion, leaving players who mainly play for that reason a little dry. However, it more than makes up for this by offering a great amount of other content, mostly filling the role of player customization.  This includes but isn't limited to; glamours to change how your armor looks, unlockable and purchasable hairstyles to pizzaz your appearence, as well as an open world player housing system that can alone cost you 100s of hours to build your dream house.

All in all, 11/10, would buy again.",2021/07/11,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0

"Final Fantasy XIV is really good. Unlike most MMOs it's chilled out, you can level at your own pace and there's never really a social rush or push to get to endgame content as soon as you can. I haven't even completed Heavensward just yet, as I am fixated on levelling all of my Classes to Jobs. There's a bit of everything for everyone in this game. Are you sick of your MMO adding silly systems that are there just to waste your time? Then FF XIV is the MMO for you! You have to have a certain disposition towards cat girls and small munchkin looking characters. Even if you don't have this disposition, no worries! Play the game a little and you'll learn to love them thanks to the BRILLIANT story writing. The kind of story that you can see has had passion pumped into it.

"This MMO is wonderful! Lots of Final Fantasy-esque cutscenes, some glorious, some sad, some hilarious, and you can choose to play them in your supported language or in the original Japanese, which is very nice. While there's alot of mandatory group content (Dungeons, Trials, Raids), Duty Roulette (the auto-queue mechanic) makes sure you don't need RL people to play with you - it's basically instant-queue if you pick a healer or tank, takes a few minutes if you pick a DPS class (on my shard/server, that is, didn't test all servers, ofc). 

Speaking of classes, you can basically learn them all on the same toon, so no need to stress if you suddenly decide you want to play a Dragoon instead of a Summoner. The game itself has a main story that's fairly linear (slight changes depending on your starting city), plus class/job quests and alot of skippable sidequests (which I do anyway, they're fun!). You're a customizable silent protagonist who nods alot, but they still managed to make you feel as if you were part of that world and commited to help those nice Eorzean NPCs.

I like it here.
A lot.
I am already fluent in weeaboo.
I plan to set up a little weeb house, right in ""Weeb Valley"" county.

"I have played WoW since 2007, and since have wracked up countless hours across every class, and have done most of the content the game has to offer, from raiding to PvP, to collecting mounts.

With that being said, it is without any doubt in my mind, that FF14 is simply the better game. WoW has done nothing but cannibalize itself since the release of Cataclysm, and FF14 is WoW without the things that made me want to switch to FF14.

Final Fantasy 14 has given me more enjoyment in the week I've owned it than WoW has in the past 14 years. This game is simply a masterpiece of the MMO genre. There are no systems in Final Fantasy 14 that make you feel like you are wasting your time, on the contrary, there are systems that make you want to waste your time to progress them. The rewards feel good, there are genuinely rare, distinguishing items that players can accumulate that differentiate themselves from the masses, you remember peoples names when you see these items, which creates a sense of community and overall makes the game just feel bigger.

"The bad: ARR is a slog at times, I wish the filler quests would get cut down even more than they already have been. Dungeons don't really pose any threat until your hundreds of hours into the game either which is disappointing as the story can have a huge amount of build-up then you beat the final boss of ARR in 30 seconds. Some jobs e.g Dragoon are very boring to level with not having many abilities during ARR.

The good: The music is great, the story is great when it gets going. There's actually characters you grow to care about. The job system not requiring alts allows for a in-depth linear MSQ that makes the game never feel like you don't know what you should do next. The rotations of most jobs are really in-depth. Lots of varied content that doesn't waste your time  e.g grinding for a 0.03% drop chance item like other MMO's do. You can get a token after 100 kills if a rare doesn't drop a mount for instance.

"Finishing A Realm Reborn (ARR) and the pre-patches leading to Heavensward has taken me 103 hours over 7 days. There are thousands of lines of text to read and many hours of both voiced and unvoiced cutscenes, which you can take at your own pace and all of which is mandatory to get to the first expansion.

Just a few notes on my time played: it works out to be around 14 hours a day, and some of those hours, I was exhausted, so reading was much slower. Some hours I was taking breaks or doing household chores. I chose to play the game between 2-4pm and 6-9am, so the mandatory dungeons had 20-60 minute wait times. I also went from 8 levels above the quest to 3 levels below, so 46-49 I had to grind out.

There are 213 ARR quests, 80 Pre-patch quests, and 15 hidden* mandatory quests you must do, totalling 308 quests to get to Heavenward and 14 job quests which are arguably mandatory. My little Chocobo and the Crystal Tower quests are stated to be mandatory; however, you are not forced into them until the questline hard-locks you from continuing with no explanation beyond ""you must do this to continue."" There are 25 (from what I can remember) mandatory dungeons ranging from 4-8-24 in group size. I also made the mistake of picking DPS and playing in off-peak hours, so my queue times were anything from instant (2-4 minutes) to 60 minutes. A quick note on pre-patch quests gives around 4k XP, and 50-51 is about 1mil XP, so do your daily dungeons/trials.

Overall, the story is excellent and really sets up for an exciting story; however, some really pointless quests are mixed with really well-told ones. Handing out uniforms not long after defeating a demi-god kind of bad quests. Running around the 3 major cities to recruit people before that. 
The worst example of this for me is the 21 quests that lead up to Titan. From proving your might to creating a feast to find out that the person supposed to help you during this endeavour is the key to getting to him was soul-crushingly dull. 
The game also makes fun of making the ""champion of light"" do these tasks as you obediently *nod head in agreement*, which is hilarious and sometimes annoying. ""We need to escape now!"" *Nod* ""Arrest this man"" *Shake head.*

One point which needs to be addressed is that this game is not an MMO, not right now. I am playing a single-player game with coop elements. All crafting guides, all the resources for these unique and exciting systems seem gated by the MSQ, which means that if you enjoy crafting, fishing, and gathering, there will be a point you will hit a brick wall and cannot continue. 
My crafting experience was looking to get a resource, struggling to find where to gather it and seeing the shops that sell it. This mystical ""materials vendor"", which seems to have everything I need, is not readily available in the 3 starting major cities. After 80 hours, I found out there is one in player houses, I believe or something on that section, but I don't want my experience crafting to be in someone else's house.

The community is generally more friendly than most, but there are absolutely unfriendly people. My first experience in ""The Balance"" Discord which seems to be the unofficial discord for FF14, was complaining about Reddit posts that were highly upvoted and were incredibly defensive when I mentioned my long queue times as if I called their child ugly.
There is also the not-unfriendly but not welcoming silence which looks pretty prominent. The multiplayer silence you come to expect when using automated systems. 
During this 100 hour journey, I have read many posts about other people's struggles with the story and how unhelpful the majority response is. The general sentiment to the MSQ and either get through it reading everything, or skip it and don't complain. 

My final bad point about this game. There are hundreds of bots. Playing in off-peak hours, I can see anywhere from 10-20 bots all doing the exact same quest at the same time teleporting from NPC to NPC wearing the same gear. You may never see them, but you sure as hell can hear them. If you ever hear someone randomly getting hurt near you, look down with damage numbers turned on. You will see them underground and occasionally pop up to talk to the NPC, then disappear back underground. If you ever want to see them fly under the Eastern Thanalan bridge and wait, there are 3 objectives under there, and you will see them teleport to each one.

This paragraph is a spoiler for 2.55 to explain why buying a skip is a bad idea. The last 3 quests of 2.55 explain how you were framed, why Alphinaud is upset and why all your friends are in prison. 2.1-2.55 is the foundation upon which Heavensward is built. People who say, ""just buy the skip for 2.1-2.55"", clearly have not played it for a long time.

To conclude my first 100 hours, this is not an MMO for me; there are at least another 100 hours ahead of the story. I will still not have access to end-game content, so for now, it is an RPG, a Final Fantasy game. The pacing is a little off. From what I am told and many posts I've read, this is where the game gets much better. Do not be mistaken; your first experience of this game will be alone, and even if you try to bring a friend, they will be forced to do many things without you. This was designed to be a single-player experience with coop parts. If you want an MMO experience, you will have to pay for the multiple skips, and the cost will be the story. The best way to think of this is a Final Fantasy game which the epilogue is an MMO.

Edit: 219 hours and two weeks since the start of my journey into FF14, I have just finished HW & 3.1 - 3.56 reaching level 66. The post patches are by far the best storytelling I have seen so for. I rerolled to a Astrologian and left Dragoon behind. I've joined a Free company and made several friends which ultimately slowed my journey but made it much more enjoyable. Spending far too much of the Mog station and now I'm going to continue to Stormblood.

Edit 2: 307 hours and 6 days since HW on 17/07/2021 now 23/07/2021 and moving onto Shadowbringers. The story has drastically improved, the beginning was slow but it is to be expected given the storyline. I'm settled on my job so despite being 77 going into Shadowbringers my intention is to finish the game as astro probably hitting level 80 either tomorrow or the day after.

"This game demands patience because it opens up so slowly. Spend the first 30 hours running around, understanding the system, before you finally get a hint of the big story plot. 

From then on, you start to see the plot unravel and charismatic villains popping up, which should ensure the next few hundred (or thousand) entertaining hours that follow.

Pro: Atmosphere is community driven. There are tons of things to do. Developers made sure to create a world that you will want to live in. Musical score in every area is hauntingly beautiful. Everyone is friendly and helpful. 30 free trial days to play and decide.

Combat system is good because there are so many classes and jobs playing different roles. You can do all of them with just one character, which does not require you to create alts like in other MMO.

You can Solo as long as you are aware of your surroundings.

Partying is easy, even with strangers. Just continue exploring or questing, while queuing for dungeon. System auto searches and fills up party, then teleports you to dungeon. When done, system teleports you back to where you were previously.

Really smart system of encouraging senior players to continue playing lower level dungeons, while still gaining some form of in-game currency.

Finally, a MMO where crafting is not boring. The crafting system is designed as a mini game, where you actually have to pay attention to reap the most benefits, or risk losing all your raw materials. Not just a crafting of spamming buttons.

Gone are the days of farming and grinding mats for your crafting. Square Enix allows you to use NPCs to farm for you. Using in-game currency. This allows you to actually enjoy the playing part of a MMO.

Con: Cut scenes are sometimes voice acted, sometimes not. Inconsistent Quality. Being forced to always read subtitles 99.9% of the time, distracts the player from the nice artwork. To prove my point, why even bother to draw the NPC lips move when my eyes are focused on the text box? 

Some quests are unnecessary and draggy. Advice to newcomers, just focus on the Main Story Progression.

Inventory management can be very messy, when you start to have many classes/jobs and crafts. Sometimes I unknowingly sold off something another lower level will use.

Dungeons are not tied to lore, more serving as an extension to the world environment. Pity.

"So I played WoW for about 2 years, but I am a fan of MMOs in general. I just want to mention I was suprised to see the games rating on Steam at like 85%. This is weird. Most are about the steam client, though there were some about the community. The rumor is: The community is toxic and doesn't like new players.

In my experience in 70+ hours so far, I have not yet met one player who is negative or mean, OR disrespects newbies. In fact, I made it a habit to when I entered a Dungeon for the first time (as tank might I add) I would disclaim to my party I was a first time tank, and might not know my way around. 99% of the time I was met with ""Ok no problem we will help you out"". If I asked that in WoW, I would have been kicked from the party no joke. I must say though, the community isn't toxic BUT it is.. different. It can be way more cringe is what I'm saying. But not harmful.

Character creation is a nightmare. I'm trying to create a second character but all the preferred servers are locked, even the one with my first character.

"tldr: 
- Lack of typical forms of chat takes away from the ""MMO"" aspect of the game.  
- Combat is even more dumbed-down than other negative reviews might lead you to believe. 
- Class skills are predetermined - no skill trees. 
- It takes many hours to download.  
- There are no refunds.

**Be warned** you have to agree that you are not entitled to a refund before it allows you to even download this game.  Then, to make sure you don't get a refund, it has a launcher which counts as playtime while you download it at a painfully slow 2MB/s.  I had 10 hours ""played"" before I even launched the game so it was well past the 2 hour limit for refunds.  I only actually played the game for about 3 hours.  This was my experience though.

I spent the 11th hour trying to log in.  I went through the character creation (which was good) then it suggested a server for me.  I picked that one and it said ""This world is not accepting any more new characters"".  There was no way to select a different server so I had to start over on the character creation.  I did this several times before getting into the game.

I spent hours 12 and 13 setting up the UI as it was all jumbled on my 4k screen.  There are a nice amount of options to set the UI how you want it but it's far from intuitive and it was not very playable by default for me.

I wanted to ask for help... That leads me to my biggest complaint that I did not know before I purchased despite reading several reviews:  There is no chat!  No global chat, no trade chat, no help chat... The only way to talk to people is 'say', 'yell', or 'shout' which apparently nobody uses.  Despite being in a city booming with other players, I never saw anyone talk.  There is a guild chat but I had no idea how to even find a guild without being able to talk to anyone.  Are you just supposed to whisper people randomly?  For an MMO to lack one of the most basic functions of an MMO was almost enough of a dealbreaker for me to quit.

But I decided I'd just treat it like a singleplayer game and carry on since I wasn't getting a refund.  It was quite some time running back and forth in the city talking to UNVOICED npcs, most of which were the child-looking race, before I was able to step outside.  Now, I had read that the combat starts out slow so I thought I was prepared for that.  But OMG.  It's so boring.  Dumbed-down to the point I felt like I was playing a game designed for wee kids.  There are no skill trees.  You get your predetermined skills at predetermined levels and that's it.  You don't even have to loot.  As soon as you kill something, its loot just goes straight to your inventory.  I leveled up several times without really doing anything except tab,1,2, tab, 1,2, etc.  I did this for about an hour before giving up.  

Another issue (which is more of a pet peeve) is when games try to reinvent the wheel.  Doing things differently just for the sake of being different.  Examples in FFXIV:  
Guilds are called ""free companies"" instead of guilds?
Health potions are blue instead of red?
Classes are called jobs?
UI elements arranged different from other mmos for no apparent reason other than to be different.
There were many other things that aren't coming to me off the top of my head but they all collectively serve to make the game less intuitive.  

Positives:  I'm sure there are many positives that I didn't get to in my short time playing but it's certainly a beautiful game and it played smoothly with no 'bugs' that I noticed.  I'm pretty sure all of the problems I experienced were 'as intended'.  

Typically, I would have let all of this go, took my refund, and just called the game 'not for me'.  However, the circumvention of Steam's refund policy (and my subsequent wasting of $20) compelled me to post this negative review so that I may prevent others like myself from making the same mistake.  

I read reviews before I purchased and about 20 out of 20 negative reviews I read only complained about the inability to buy expansions from the website and use them on the steam version.  People should know that there are other negative aspects.

"So i just finished the first part of this game , A realm reborn, and even without touching the expansions i would highly, highly, Highly recomend this game. If you are standoffish because you have never really dabbled in MMO's before worry not. This game strikes a very good line between traditional RPGS, MMO's, And a killer story mode. The main quests were so good i often found myself forgetting i was actually playing a MMO. 

I will say that it is kinda slow at the beginning and it all seems very different when you first start playing. Trust me though once you start getting the hang of the UI and game mechanics you will enjoy the ride. So excited to get to the expansions now. 

*BTW from everything i have heard and read, the expansions are a million times better then the first part of the game which for me is saying a whole lot.

"Final Fantasy XIV is a game I wholeheartedly recommend to both MMORPG players and Final Fantasy franchise fans, and it keeps getting better in every expansion. After a slow and a bit painful start, it really picks on. The main story is great, especially in expansions and unlike some competitors, it stays coherent thorough. Shadowbringers even features the best antagonist in the whole FF series so far. Classes are truly distinct and balanced well enough, every and each of them has their place and is capable of clearing all content. For people who don't care about story, dungeons and raids are really well designed and again, they also keep getting better each expansion.

"Post A Realm Reborn + Heavensward review:

I slept on this MMORPG for so long...I bought this game when Heavensward came out, renewed it again when Stormblood came out, and never touch it again...and finally really took a deep dive into playing it when Endwalker teasers and extended trials were all over the internet. Prepurchased Endwalker for the 30% exp boost earrings and got myself back into the game. Literally played ALL quests of ARR and was so happy saw the credits of ARR. On my Heavensward run I decided to follow every youtube video's advice and skip the side quest and only run the main story quest. WHAT A DIFFERENCE. I probably would have beat ARR in a few days if I did that method instead of beating ARR in several years. This only makes me wonder why even have side quests if people are going to skip them in the first place?

When you hear reviews about ARR being the worst part of the game and every other expansion being the better parts, I feel that's an opinionated response. Nonetheless it's an opinion people listen to in order to justify whether they want to buy the game or not.

Pros: Plenty of content to keep you occupied, lots of classes you can pick from and you can use them all on one character (subjective Pro,) lots of bosses and plenty of features. Customizable UI and macros. A lot of people are willing to help you out if you ask, even in the raids if say something like ""1st run"" at the start of the raid/dungeon/boss

Cons: For a beginner, a lot of the features will be tough to find unless the player actually scan every word, window, and button on the UI, not to mention the minimap has a lot of pictures where an average noobie won't think to mouse over it. Some harder raids take extremely long to matchmake like almost half an hour or longer for a pug group. Also apparantly this game is confusing to buy for some people. They don't know if they need to buy the complete edition or just the newest expansion. Not to mention the registration process is crap.

Overall I would give this a try on the free trial before buying anything, and if you DO plan on buying it, probably google up how to buy the game on Steam without getting into any confusions.",2021/07/09,0,0,0,0
"The game is fun. Feels big and massive first starting out and there's a lot of things for you to do it can get a bit overwhelming but once you find a class you like it definitely gets the ball rolling. Some of my thoughts and playing through the game was finding out how to unlock certain things in the game like unlocking a mount. Either I wasn't really paying much attention to the game or the game didn't really explain that much to me so I looked up on the internet how to get certain stuff (that is the purpose of me showing an example of the mount). Traveling is what makes it this kind of game and other games like it but for me at least it wore off pretty quickly I got really tired of running around all the time. My biggest concern is the campaign or quest line for the base game (A Realm Reborn, ARR) You beat the main quest line and there's an epilogue which includes filler quests for the narrative that pushes it into the story of the dlcs, thus continuing the story overall. The epilogue quest line for A Realm Reborn is; I'm just gonna be 100 with ya, it's boring af. 100 or so quests of filler like jeez. After being hubmled by Heavensward, Stormblood, and Shadowbringer (have yet to come back and finish that up) They definitely learned to not make f***ing 100 quests of just fetch quests kind of...but you do get introduced to one of the first raids I believe if my memory serves me right. The raids are plenty fun and you'll definitely learn the real meat and bones of the game cuz that's where it is honestly and it's just tons of fun running with like 3 teams of 8 (24 ppl, 2 tanks, 2 healers, 4 dps) I have a lot to say, but I realized this is kind of gotten long. Playing the epilogue quest line is like the dark tunnel and getting to the Heavensward dlc and the other ones are like the light at the end. Trust me, please. You 100% need the patience to get through ARR's epilogue after that, it. is. fun. You get to unlock more of your class's skills and abilities and truly bring out the potential of that class and your skill rotations become more complex but its fun to learn the whole I guess you could say combo for a more simpler term. You could do the in-game tutorial like quest to understand how to play your role (tank, healer, dps) but I'd rather watch some guides on Youtube especially for more in depth so that you can fully maximize your play potential. Tanks, learn to be one and understand you are the main source of attention. Go ham and just wack everything, but not the entire level or else the healer cannot keep up. Healers, personally I just watch my teammates' health bars you're almost never looking at the enemies', BUT that doesn't mean you don't do damage everyone's damage is important even the healers; if tank dies, everyone dies (unless somehow you died first which is a rare case once you understand how to play this game well enough). DPS, man, you really gotta learn your (what they call) rotations. This is a combination of skills and abilities that a dps class has that fully takes advantage of all the multiple and long cooldowns that they have in order to do damage. It's bascially just a super long combination of your attacks that all fits well so that in a perfectly timed manner you can do it again from the beginning of your combo.",2021/07/09,0,0,0,0

"Several quick notes: It took several days to create a account after purchase. The password and email would not sync. This is my 2nd FF14 account. I got this game years ago and same thing happened ""I never even got to log into that account"". I only have a hour or two a day to game so I gave up on FF14 after a few days of password he11. I could not get the user name and password to sync.  2nd purchase: Finally after several days I check one last time and the game recognized my user name and password. ""WEIRD Right?"" It gets better: I buy FF14 on Steam Sale for a 2nd time. Now Square Enix says: I already have a account. I look in my desk and find my password list and enter my old user name that NEVER worked the ENTIRE month of my 1st Subscription and POOF this old user name and password work with no game time. ""Its like living in the MATRIX unbelievable"" I registered my new Steam Game key to a different email account and after a few days and a final login attempt WORKED. All of that being said. FF14 is a very good game and I am glad I got to check it out. I hope all you who see this might try logging in one last time. Perhaps it might work for you too.

It may be a subscription based MMO but I think that it's very much justified once you actually start playing.  There's an absolutely huge world that I haven't even fully explored yet as well as a very welcoming player-base. i highly recommend this 11/10",2021/07/08,1,0,0.52173912525177002,0

Not because it's a dead game or broken, but because if you have a server in mind or want to join a friends server you probably won't be able to because the majority of the time the servers (at least on Aether) won't let you make new characters for them. So you'll be spending the first couple hours making your character and just sitting at the server select screen hitting refresh hoping the server you want to join opens up and you can actually play. Horribly flawed system that really needs to be changed. At the very least you should be able to make a character for that server then just join a queue until you can play. You know like in every other damn game!

After troubleshooting my PC, the client took about an hour to download, and everything worked just fine. I was ecstatic to finally make it through the first conversation without the game crashing, and afterward, I played non-stop until about level 9.

"The time played isn't accurate, I've got at least a 100 hours more on the trial version.
Compartively to WoW, this game actually feels like a game which you can play for the sports and not for the grind.
It does have dungeons, raids but also the game allegedly forces you to live the MMO, literally.
Pro's:
- The game is way more lively and fun overall
- it has RP worlds in it, which in regards of worlds - if u sign up to one world to be your home world, it doesn't mean you can't visit other worlds and there aren't many limitations which you're bound to play by under these terms.
- Community is far far less toxic than WoW's, in fact, throughout my short, yet rich time in FFXIv I've not encountered, not even once any type of toxicity.
- Characters are fairly balanced, it doesnt' matter which class  you play, they all do almost the same damage, your choice of heart should depend on which class you relate to most.
- As for raids and dungeons - in WoW, a raid can take hours.. LITERALLY, most boring thing in the world, whereas the raids in FFXIV are really fun, don't last long even if they're hard, very exciting, everything is working smoothly and straight to the point - basically you're not forced to kill thousands of mobs just to get to a single boss, instead u kill around 8-10 bosses and the more bosses you go through the harder it gets ( which is fun trust me ) 
- You can play a tones of hours just in the trial version untill you make up your mind whether you like it or not, which is essentially really good for people who need time to settle in and see if they like the game.
- The game allows you to shift between classes using just one character which is fantastic cause you don't need to go through the whole main quest storylines and shet just to get to play the class that you want, intead it can easily be done simply by a firearm switch.
There's far more i can say about this game but i don't wanna spoil it up.
- The game might not be as newbie friendly as i'd expected, i did have some confusion at first when i started playing ff14, but to contradict this, the game has implemented a chat called ""Novice Network"" it's basically a Q/A ( Questions / Answers ) helper chat, mentors and regular players both help newbies by answering their questions. and some dedicated ones would even travel from one point to another just to be even more helpful by providing physical thorough guidance.. not something you'd see in any MMO.

CONS:
Not anything big, unlike in Wow, there is a limit how high you can fly, and you can barely find 
 seas which you can swim which kinda sucks cause in WoW we can cross islands just by swimming which is amazing in my opinion.",2021/07/07,0,0,0,0

"A review from a long time World of Warcraft player;

An all around good MMO with a great community.
Interesting and engaging story, something that I think differs this from other MMORPGs.
Other games in the same category really focus on the massive multiplayer portion. This game does that but also has an engaging single player experience too.
The option to swap between roles is very cool. Keeps the game interesting and alive as you are able to switch up game play often without rerolling a new character and starting over in the story.
It has the Final Fantasy feel to it. That's also nice.

"I've been enjoying this game a lot - there is so much to do in terms of questing and areas to explore. The story is great (mind you, its slow to start).

I came from World of Warcraft after playing that for 8 years and this is a breath of fresh air. I really like that your character is able to play each class/job just by changing into a different gear set (so I can heal as a white mage and then if I felt like it, I could also level the same character as a tank). The profession type jobs in FF14 are significantly more engaging to me as a player than what WoW has to offer, and I found myself wanting to level up cooking and alchemy rather than ""oh jeez, I have to do that again?"". 

The housing option is an added bonus, but I haven't unlocked that - I hear the costs are quite high, however. I also enjoy the aesthetics of FF14, the various areas, and all of the customization that you can do with your character. One of the most interesting things I found out was the option to have a wedding in-game and that you can apply and file paperwork - and you can hold an actual ceremony - your character gets specific buffs for teleporting it looks like.

All in all, I recommend trying it out - definitely go for the free trial version first as you can level pretty much to maximum (just don't pick a server that is offering extra XP to new characters or you'll be 10 levels above the main storyline like I was :P)",2021/07/06,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0

Well, at least for me. I can understand loving this game if you enjoy story...And that's it. The combat is very dull, the characters are the only thing that looks good, the quests are bland(like any MMO), and it was just a hassle to get this game started on Steam. The download kept breaking until I decided to not surf the internet while downloading. Why? It would break, like I said. Even minimizing the launcher...It breaks. 

Also, good luck finding ANYONE for low level raids to progress through the story. I waited forever as a DPS to find NO ONE. I just quit. People said I should pick certain times where people are playing...Ok. Isn't this game popular? At least in WoW, I can just level up and go back to said low level raids to finish the story.

"Fantastic game, loads of fun to be had. I'm not a huge fan of the endgame as it's entirely aesthetics/cosmetics, mount farming and the like. Or just doing it all over again and leveling other jobs/classes. I wish it had an itemization endgame, with raids having a like .5% chance to drop a certain unique piece of armor with better stats, give players a reason to keep playing the instanced content beyond mount and transmog farming. Even so, it took me around 500 hours to get bored with the game, and if you like the crafting/gathering side of things and collecting aesthetic items, it will take you thousands of hours to get tired of the game. Well worth the money, highly recommended for anyone and everyone.",2021/07/05,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0

"Be prepared before you buy this game. I typically like MMO games, I find them enjoyable to play with friends and to do activities in. This game though, my god...This is the most boring shit you will ever stumble across from a AAA studio. 

I'll do the fans some favors and list out some positives. The soundtrack is great. The sub-class system works fine. 

That's it. Those are all the positives I can think of.

I'm going to start off with the most egregious negative of them all: the cost. Square Enix proves yet again they are the greediest publisher of all time with this game, just like the rest of their products. Charging 60 dollars upfront for the game is fine, but then you notice that they charge you monthly for a sub. I rarely play games anymore because I'm so busy, and seeing that Square Enix would like to seep money from my bank account per month for a game I'd maybe player 10 hours per month is ridiculous. It does not warrant it, not matter how good the game is. I do not feel like I am getting the appropriate time per dollar ratio spent here. On top of this, Square Enix makes it a 20 step process to cancel your sub. It's disgusting. 

The story for this game is so hard to grasp, and after a certain point I gave up trying. IMMEDIATELY upon entering the game you are hit with a WALL OF TEXT in COMPLETE SILENCE. At that very moment, I knew I probably wouldn't like this game. I love story games, they're my favorite kind of games to play and if the game has a good story I'd invest time in it. But the way this game handles its content delivery is so ridiculous. New players have to get past ""A Realm Reborn"" (more like my boredom reborn) which is a 60 hour long wall of text simulator. Players can either choose to read all of this nonsense or they can be sensible and skip all of it like almost everyone who plays this game. Like I said, everything is delivered in COMPLETE SILENCE. There are only a handful of cutscenes here that have voice acting and the voice acting SUCKS. It is laughable at best and depressing for my ears at worst.

If you are looking to play this game with your friends, do not get it. The main solo quest and most side quests are solo only. I bought this game under the intention that I would be playing with friends. NOPE. That is not the case here. You are left alone to play this hosh posh of a story by yourself. Have fun wasting many hundreds of hours on the most boring content you will ever witness.

The level design is a whole new beast here. Levels are massive in scope but not in a good ""MMO"" way. They are easy to get lost in and the minimap does absolutely nothing to help. This game has easily the worst implementation of a map I've ever seen in any game I've played by the way. Markers disappear, show up in wrong places, etc. You are often confused because each city has ""levels"" but those levels aren't drawn depending on where you are in the city, no. THEY'RE DRAWN ALL AT ONCE SO THEY STACK ON TOP OF EACH OTHER. It makes the MOST confusing map I have EVER seen in any game.

The UI is fucking atrocious. Everything is thrown together into a moshpit of nothingness and everything at once. Nothing is organized for you. You have to go through a billion different menus to reach a specific menu you want to reach.

The gameplay FUCKING SUCKS. Point, click, point, click, point, click. That's the entire game. The time between attacks feels like a god damn lifetime because the developers thought it would be hilarious to waste as much of the player's time as possible. Your basic combo loop is also extremely slow. Very long cooldowns for everything you do. 

The core gameplay loop suffers because of this. On top of the terrible combat system, the quest system is a mind boggling mess. The entire first 200 hours of the game is fetch quests. Do you like traveling across the planet to deliver a few pretzels? This is the game for you. I feel like I'm playing Death Stranding, but at least Death Stranding was strategic in how the player interacts with the physics implementation, which then offered enjoyable relaxing gameplay. Nothing about this is relaxing, it's infuriating. I feel like I'm about to explode every time I play this game, and turn into a walking ball of flame and anger. 

Sound design is abhorrent. The entire game seems like it's been made up of stock sound effects. For a company that is worth millions and millions of dollars, they'd at least spend the money to invest in better sound effects. Everything is ""clink clack  clink clack clink clack"". 

The community is also very strange for this game. I've met some really nice people who have become good friends of mine, but there are a lot of people who bullshit their way into cheating you out of the things you earn and work for. Guilds are insufferable in this game. I won't go into this too much because this is something you need to experience yourself, but it's bad...

This game is a scam. It's as simple as that. The friends you have that will probably try to convince you into buying this game are lying to you. There is nothing enjoyable here unless if you like great music, in which case buy the OST. The community praise this game for everything I just listed as a negative. This game is hands down not enjoyable at all. It would be excusable if Square Enix removed 90% of the content (which is fluff anyway) and focused on only the good parts of the game. I'd rather have a 20 hour long great story, than a 400 hour long story that is filled with meaningless horseshit that we are supposed to care about.

If you are looking for a good Final Fantasy game, skip this and play Final Fantasy 7 Remake instead.
If you are looking for a good MMO to play, play Star Wars The Old Republic. That game is free to play and offers focused, quality content for everyone. 

This game is bad. Do not buy.",2021/07/05,3,5,0.449666023254394531,3

"Purchased this game thinking I'd give it a try. Worst decision ever!! You can't play it unless you make a Square Enix account. I have been unable to make the account using Steam or directly from the Square Enix website. If there is an error during the account setup you can't attempt again for 24 hours. I have tried 4 different times using 4 different email accounts and all have failed. Tech support is horrible because to submit a ticket you need to have an account. Since the problem is that I can't make an account I can't submit a ticket.

I know there is still hundreds of hours of things I can still do at max level however I don't feel like I need to do any of it to have a full Experience with this game. I don't feel as though I have to go through any chores to get everything I really want. I can without a doubt in my mind say that this is the best MMO on the market and while I was off put by the art style and the giant differences between FF14 and wow after I took the leap into this game I never want to go back. 

I will say this to caution new players. It took me 3 tries over the years to get into this game. A realm reborn is not the most fun but while the story can get a little boring it will keep you entertained while you learn your class and progress in other ways. The most important thing you should know is if your not having fun with a class that its okay to put that class down and try a new one.

"[TL;DR at the bottom] 

Final Fantasy has never been a franchise that I was into. I played a lot of them, from 1 through 8 and dropped all but the Spin-off titles like Crisis Core or Dissidia. I have also been a very performance oriented MMO Player and stuck to WoW ever since just a couple months before The Burning Crusade released and very successfully raided Mythic from Legion to Shadowlands, did high ranking in Classic PvP etc. Even though this firmly places me in a category that is not the target audience, I can confidently say that FF14 is a great JRPG and a phenomenal MMO – not the other way around.

To get some common MMO-Stuff out of the way: Quest design is nothing special. Kill/Gather/Escort with few gimmicks being introduced outside of special Scenario missions or dungeon content. Sidequests kind of lack proper rewards and tend to only give you small amounts of experience and some pocket change. Crafting is a big focus, but not in the way MMO's usually handle it. Rather than solely crafting through a menu, each crafting-job levels up like a regular class – getting their own abilities that tweak the crafting minigame. Suffice it to say, there are players out there, who consider their crafting class to be their main and I can absolutely understand where they are coming from. Class/Job Identity at large is very much a thing, to the point where Bards get access to playing a musical instrument as a minigame, which is detailed enough to spawn entire communities around it. The first guild I joined is a good example for this; our leader being someone who solely plays for the housing and said music minigame rather than PvE/P. 

PvP especially is not well supported and therefore has only a small playerbase engaging with it on a regular basis. PvE is harder to judge – Dungeons are great but fairly easy during the leveling process, whereas Trials and Raids respectively rival WoW in their design. Trials are essentially 1-room, 1-boss encounters, whereas raids refer to the typical raid structure of multiple encounters. Typically, FF14 is noted to not be as strong in terms of offering PvE content, though I firmly believe this is more due to higher difficulty raids not featuring as much of a reward in player power than other MMO's rather than whether the encounters are difficult, fun, or well-designed or not. So while it is hard to find groups of players to tackle that content, it is still immensely rewarding for those players that excel in raiding and there is still prestige and player-power to be earned.

“Well-designed” is a bit of a loose term but I refer with this to both the mechanical complexity of boss-fights, as well as their visual design and soundtrack. For instance, it's not super common to have unconventional fights like [spoiler]FF6's Phantom Train[/spoiler] make a cameo as a proper bossfight that needs to be tuned around MMO raid-mechanics. Equally, having a soundtrack that doesn't just make for a fitting background track, but actually ties into the fight you're doing by, for example, featuring the boss itself singing the vocals, or featuring lyrics that tie into its lore, is something that works surprisingly well. If you're open to mild spoilers about a mid-game boss from the second expansion, I'd encourage looking up [spoiler]Lakshmi's[/spoiler] fight on YouTube.

This kind of attention to detail and little facets that work to tweak and enhance your experience oozes from every system FF14 employs. The Gold Saucer is the best example that comes to mind, featuring a wealth of minigames from Chocobo Breeding/Racing to Mahjong to a Lottery, all of which could be well worth a paid game in itself. Another example would be mounts featuring their own unique music tracks, animations and interactions, or pieces of gear giving you unique emotes. On the flipside, exploration is lackluster. Aside from being visually impressive, zones in FF14 are cut-off by loading screens and feature invisible walls on flying mounts and thus, exploration ranges from disappointing to nearly pointless.

That all being said, two things that are constantly being brought up in discussions about the game is the massive focus on its story – building up to between 200 and 300 hours just to reach the current expansion Shadowbringers, and the friendliness of the community. The latter is much easier to address in that, yes, people don't tend to flame others and whatever, but that's more due to it feeling like other players have a gun to the back of their head at all times. It's actually uncanny to experience things like a tank after a wipe mention “Good job healers!” - not knowing whether its sarcasm or not and the guy immediately being dogpiled about his toxicity. Equally, damage meters and similar addons are a grey-area, where you're not really supposed to use them and “talking down” to others about their performance could result in a warning or suspension. 

The quality of the story feels a bit overhyped. Yes, FF14's storytelling easily eclipses other MMO's but at its heart remains very JRPG-ish. For people who cannot get into the Tales of [Cringe] series, other FF's etc., FF14 will also remain a fairly uninteresting and cliched experience. While skipping cutscenes is frowned upon, the game actually does a great job in its questlog, recapping the events and each step of any quest, which makes it easy to skip cutscenes to just get back into the action whenever you feel like it. This is something that can remedy long slogs of exposition, like the infamous ARR-wall where you could very well be confronted with literally hours of being sent back and forth between characters like you're playing a visual novel. I, for one, enjoyed it, but I'm also a filthy Neptunia-Respecter and would claim that the game being as weeby as it is, is a good thing rather than doing the cope of repeating “Well, originally FF was a DnD meme so technically”.


[u]TL;DR[/u]
+ Immense attention to detail in every aspect of the game.
+ Some of the best encounter-design in any MMO; Including visual- and sound presentation aside from raw boss mechanics.
+ Well balanced Class/Job system with a unique take on MMO crafting that encourages active gameplay.
+ Barely any technical issues . No broken quests or encounters.
+ A myriad of peripheral content: Music instruments, housing etc. Being able to play all jobs on a single character allows for a feeling of constant character progression.
+ Lalafell

+/- Extreme story focus leading to a properly fleshed-out and immersive world at the cost of lengthy exposition and pacing issues. This can be remedied through the usually descriptive questlog and its NG+ system.
+/- Welcoming and friendly, but equally oppressive community.
+/- Extremely well-designed PvE Content, that however lacks the rewards to support it and therefore may lead to issues of players finding a dedicated group to tackle said content on a basis comparable to other MMO's.

- Bad Steam integration. Both Launcher and Account-Management Sites are flawed and rough to navigate.
- Excessive monetization (Expansion Cost - Subscription - Cash Shop).
- Lalafell.

Playing Final Fantasy 14 after more than a decade of actively playing WoW, as well as tons of other MMO's from Guild Wars to Elsword to Vindictus to Black Desert Online to ESO, it's actually nuts how far above the crowd FF14 is in almost every aspect. Even the kind of content the game does not focus on, like hardcore raiding or exploration, it only marginally lacks behind its competition. The large barrier of entry is a bit of a double-edged sword, meaning that the community that sticks with it through hundreds of hours of questing is actually dedicated to the game, but also making it kind of difficult to get into the game in the first place. It's a journey as much for the story, as for you to develop your character and it's well worth going through, as long as you don't buy into some of the rabid playerbase's promises to deliver the moon :) to you.",2021/07/04,2,0,0.545347213745117188,0

"Not a fan
I had a jarring experience was really hard to get immersed ill run off a few issues i had.

Questing i found my self mindlessly going through the motions. Pick up, do, complete.
When i attempted to get into the story the way the dialogue was delivered is like reading WOW's quests with scrolling on
was a really jarring and almost tedious experience (ive been told the story gets good after first expansion but i refuse to pay for a boost or a content skip as it defeats the purpose)

The world has has invisible walls and boundary boxes everywhere really breaks any immersion and feels like a cheap PS3 game as well as load zones which take the world from a real deep feeling and rich environment to a segregated mess   
Not only that the monster pollution can feel a bit out of control as if somone said ill put a few bats here maybe a few chickens there with no rhyme or reason

Mounts and aesthetics some of it is really cool other stuff is jarring im playing a fantasy game yet i see people driving bat mobiles in jeans and a t shirt makes the game feel like second life with rpg elements 

No talents or gearing options to make your characters stand apart or really optimise how you would like to play (note i had to look this up) and this point really killed the game for me

Combat is good although monsters in the world pose no challenge even those they put the effort in to give them unique and telegraphed ability's and yes im sure the end game does offer plenty of challenging content that would feel rewarding but with the way gear works really offers me no intensive aside from achievements and mounts/aesthetics 

I mean if i had to sum it up id say
the base game is so bad they brought out a content skip that you pay for 
Questing im sure there is a rich and great story but the way in which it is delivered is tedious mind numbing
The world feels gated and like a cheap ps3 game with zoned areas has trouble capturing my imagination 
and the best way i can explain my experience its like if second life had rpg elements

This experience pushed me away from playing as a new player and what sealed the deal was the lack of talent / gear diversity ontop of my current experiences there was nothing for me to look forward to

"[h1]Final Fantasy XIV[/h1]

[i]Let me begin by saying this game offers an extensive free trial system, allowing the leveling of all classes to level 60 as well as completion of the main story all the way through the first expansion. Not many games will offer this many hours of entertainment within a ""free trial"". [/i]

[b]With that out of the way:[/b]

    Fans of the Final Fantasy lineage will be right at home here, with familiar enemies making appearances as well as recurring bosses. The community is fantastic and very welcoming of new players, called sprouts due to the small plant sprout icon next to new players names. There is a Novice Network chat channel where new players can ask questions or ask for help, and among the players in that channel can be found Mentors who are there to aid in your journey. The graphics have aged well, and the music is phenomenal as is to be expected from Final Fantasy.

    The main story quests are the primary form of early game progression, and in the original game can feel overwhelming and slow. Finishing the original story and reaching the first expansion is undoubtedly one of the most difficult parts about getting into the game properly, and is a result of the large number of sluggish quests required to complete it. After making it through that initial hump however, the game picks up and becomes one of the best MMO storylines available. 

[i]A note for players coming from other games:[/i]

    While PvP does exist within FFXIV, it is not a focus and never has been. If you are looking for an MMO solely for the purposes of PvP you may want to skip over this one. However if you are looking for an amazing PvE experience, nice scenery and stories, and a well established social network, then FFXIV might just be for you.

Raids are SUPER fun and mechanic heavy. Hell even Hard Modes of the dungeons at level 50 will give mechanics that cause you to wipe the first few times until you properly plan for them.

best mmo ever for anyone and especially FF fans,2021/07/03,1,0,0,0
"Overlyhyped jap-SWTOR, barely an MMO at this point:

no class customization whatsoever, once you pick a class you will be playing them in exactly the same way for all content.

class design amounts to repetitive, deterministic damage rotations, with no other ways to interact with mobs.

longwinded, cliche ridden and boring story where you play the role of both a mary sue and a deus-ex machina

the poorest quest design i have ever seen in a MMO, you spend most of your time teleporting to npcs to watch cutscenes

devs are afraid to innovate, so you end up with rehashed content and rigid gameplay. the game hasn't changed since 2013 except for stripping everything down.

the tab-targeting system unironcally functions worse than WoW Classic's tab targeting from fucking 2004

absolutely nothing about combat has proper tactile feedback, animation locks and poor netcode bog down everything.

boring itemization

vertical progression from start to finish. barely even an rpg

claustrophobic and flat map design, invisible walls everywhere and almost no verticality in zones

open world becomes an irrelevant lobby pretty quickly, and you barely explore it during the story either

idiotic level sync system that prevents you from using higher level skills, which totally fucks up your rotation muscle memory

all content except the very end game is mindnumbingly easy and even then savage raids aren't too difficult compared to other MMOs.

very little raid content, period. 4 bosses in a major patch is laughable

small group content (4 mans) offers absolutely zero meaningful gameplay at any stage in the game

awful PVP, the worst in any MMO, and demonstrates just how much arbitrary padding PVE rotations have by condensing full combos into one button

faux-friendly community that is petri-fucking-fied of being reported and banned for upsetting someones fragile little ego. criticism is ""toxic"" here.

No gearing incentive, upgrades every patch are tiny and don't matter for any other content. No customization and it has only gotten further simplified over time.

Devs constantly use ""engine limitations"" and ""budget limitations"" as reasons not to do something, ending up with a very barebones endgame content. Can't even add full races because of this and remove types of gear just to be able to expand inventory

Many of the systems in place are lacking in comparison to other mmo's, such as glamor and glamor storage
The crafting system that gets praised so much doesn't even make anything that affects gameplay beyond basic food buffs and dps increase potions, and maybe an armor set that makes the gearing even more pointless each patch

"This game is a love letter to final fantasy fans. It starts off very slow with a lot of explanations, talking to Npc after Npc. But when you get to the killing and past the 1st 18 levels or so ( which should take 5-10 hours depending how you explore ), it will grow on you and not let go.... The story is captivating, the music is incredible, the amount of content ( espeically if you get complete edition ) is mind-blowing. So many classes, so many jobs, they give the choice of 8 at start but there's at least double that. And that's not talking about gathering and crafting from fishing to botanist, miner, goldsmith, armorer, you get a lot of choice. And you can be everything on THE SAME CHAR. Just need to learn intro quest to it, switch to weapon needed ( like a frying pan for culinary, lance for lancer etc...) and there you go. There's a lot of dungeons, bosses and side activities, including Gold Saucer ! which hosts tons of activities from races, to cards, to a minion game, mahjong, jump puzzles.. There's just so much !!! Of course there's mounts and you can eventually fly. The community is overall very kind, having met maybe 2 rude person in my 200 total hours ( near 160 on Windows version, 44 here ). There's also glamour and housing with decoration and soooooo many references to past FF games, it's almost ""fan service, the game, but with also great content and story"".. Try it out, you get a free trial that is VERY generous and see why this, is, right now, the number 1 MMORPG.",2021/07/03,0,0,0,0

Systems are great, gameplay is rewarding and graphics amazing. It as a really fun gameplay loop as well.

"I could probably write a paper about XIV with how many hours I've spent in it, but I'll keep it simple: This is the best MMO currently on the market, and I'm still playing it after I started in 2016. I'd recommend it to anyone that cares about story-centric MMOs, FF fans, or for anyone looking for a game that gives an abundance of options for Roleplaying in a multiplayer space. Hardcore players looking to challenge themselves might find it lacking, but I'm not a part of the hardcore base so I can't really comment on it.

My advice for new players: 
1. Take your time - This isn't the kind of MMO where you want to rush yourself to the endgame, there's a lot to experience, and it's not all at the end.
2. Enjoy the story - A lot of endgame content is gated behind anyway, so you might as well sit back and relax. This is a numbered Final Fantasy title, it's not any less story-focused because it's an MMO.

And to any longtime players reading this: 
Stop telling new players to skip A Realm Reborn, it's their first time, let them play it and make that decision for themselves on subsequent playthroughs.",2021/07/03,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0

"This is one of the worse games I have ever played in my life.

I tried to like this game, I really did. I bought into the hype that currently surrounds this game, watched the documentaries surrounding it, tried to get into the universe etc but at the core there are so many things wrong with it that I can't see how it could be a good game, ever.

I've played many, many MMOs over my lifetime, from all the big ones to lesser known Asian run-of-the-mill ones to the early ones dating to 90s etc as well as couple of FF games, like 7, 8, Crisis Core, Dissidia that I all liked. This, however is IMO fundamentally broken.
* From what I experienced, it has 0 innovation, anything it has has been repeated 100 times over by other games way better, IMO.
* The early game is worst there ever is for any game, I've never played a game where I felt so bored for hours after hours.
* The movement is extemely clunky, it does not feel fluid at all.
* The skill system is utter garbage, early the 2.5s GCD makes everything a snoozefest while later to me it seems like you just get some filler abilities that you weave between gcd? It feels clunky and I can't imagine it getting better and from what I've seen from the endgame videos where there is a lot of skill bloat I can't really see myself praising this system, ever.
* The zones feel super clunky as well, like I feel extremely restricted in these tiny zones with all sorts of invisible barriers.
* The graphics, I honestly don't care about graphics but they are as bland, generic and unimpressive as possible.
* The game is praised for its story - I admit I've liked every single FF story I've seen so far - yet, its all dialogue, with 0 voice acting and extremely bad cut scenes. Very hard to get immersed to the point I don't really care to even keep track of any of it if I don't force myself.
* Dungeons are as bland as possible, linear zones, 0 tactics, even vanilla WoW has better ones.

I'm sure I'd keep finding more negatives if I kept playing it but at this point I don't care to continue. This game is a hype trap that has achieved some sort of status where you're not allowed to say anything bad about it while the game itself is extremely mediocre at best. I don't know if it's because the people that have the recent love-hate relationship with WoW that have migrated to this and have never-ever played anything else and praise it solely to show a big middle finger to WoW or whatever.

Some people say it gets better as you progress in it, with the core systems like movement etc being as bad as they are, I don't see it. Even if it does there is 0 excuse to have early game to be as big pile of shit that it currently is where I'd have to force myself for tens of hours to get through it.

"WARNING! This is a story driven game first and foremost! 

That being said, the endgame community is something I have never been able to find in other games, groups that you can just ~join~ allowing you to find people to share in your experience as you learn about or explore the world. Rivaling the enjoyment I had for other large MMOs, FFXIV has become my defacto timesink, to the point of creating multiple characters to explore the story through a different lens, despite the fact that every character can be every class, job, or crafting profession. FFXIV's rebirth from a buggy, copy pasta, mess at its 1.0 launch into a playable game at 2.0, and an immersive story that builds and calls back to every experience you've had until now as each successive expansion drops, makes FFXIV not just an MMO in my opinion, but something of a legend, with documentaries about its transformation through the years that begs to be watched and appreciated. FFXIV has built, brick by brick, a tower reinforced by its community that now threatens to dwarf even the titans of the MMO gaming world, and I am ecstatic to be a part of it.

Edit* I would like to emphasize, however, that should you decide to purchase FFXIV, doing so through the dedicated Square Enix website with a standalone account would be far better than through Steam. Your account is locked to whichever version you purchase first for PC, and later expansions MUST be purchased through the same means. I.E. if you downloaded and authorized FFXIV's Free trial, allowing you to explore ARR and the First expansion for free, each expansion you purchase past that point for that account MUST be through Steam.",2021/07/02,0,0,0,0

"After playing a couple of other MMOs I can really appreciate what FF does for the player, it really feels like a game made by someone who knows how the experience of being a player feels like.  Truly one of the bests if not the best MMOs I've ever played, as a new player I really appreciate the incredibly wholesome community and the game is incredibly detailed explaining every aspect gradually to new players.

[b] I love: [/b]
- Experience all the content on a single character, changing classes whenever I want to
- Classes are incredibly well balanced
- Gathering and crafting is incredibly developed, fun and useful believe it or not.
- The story is a bit slow at the begging but it really pays off as it progresses
- The community feels alive and its incredibly wholesome and helped me a lot as a new player
- There's a huge variety of instances (dungeons) 
- The gear for the most part looks great and if I don't like it I can always ""glam"" it (head gear and weapon can be hidden)
- Lots of FF nostalgia and easter eggs for the franchise fans.
- The game looks gorgeous and the music is not only beautifull but it also changes to adapt to current scenario which is great.
-Great emphasis on story telling for those who enjoy it but plenty of content outside of it for those who don't care.

 [b] Some things people might not like [/b]
- Races are not as varied as other MMOs, most of them are human, small human, big human, cat human, horny (horned) human
- The game being a Japanese RPG game is very anime in some ways and might not appeal to everyone
- Not that PvP is bad, but it could improve

Seriously just try it. The game has a free trial which includes the base game ( FFXIV - A Realm Reborn) + the first expansion (Heavensward).

"The fourteenth entry in the famed FINAL FANTASY series, and an MMORPG. It allows you to swap between jobs freely and experience a grand story on par with some other FF titles like VI and IX. As expected, being an MMORPG, this game has a plethora of callbacks to previous entries while allowing to create a unique world of its own. The global cooldown system is around 2.5 seconds for most actions; keeping in line series tradition with Active Time Battle being the same length. Despite the cooldown of 2.5 seconds, this game allows you to weave in combos and other moves that creates a sort of flow for each fight, in both higher and lower difficulties.

I have never raged quit a game before even playing it before until this game. Even so, I am now finally able to play after 3+ Days of researching and attempting troubleshoots and 10+ hours installing the damn game. 

FOR ANYONE THAT EXPERIENCES THE SAME ERROR,
What worked for me was a combination of deleting the extra patch folder 4e9a232b and additionally going into documents and finding the boot file and bringing the Bootconfig property from 0 to 1. THEN, I had to literally baby the install and not allow my computer to go into sleep mode or even let my monitor go off for even a moment for 10+ hrs.

I cried like 5 times playing this game. I have to say at least give this game a try if you are into mmo's because this is a pretty damn good one!
AND if you have friends it would be quite helpful because there is loads of stuff to do in this game that can kind of be overwhelming.

In 8 hours i encountered 2 voice acted scenes. the rest you gotta read.
Combat is cartoonishly flashy.

"✔️Pros:
➤  I don't know if the game being a Final Fantasy game is a PRO or a CON with the CONS 
      below in mind.
➤  Against the overwhelming CONS of the game i genuinely can't think of any PROS.

❌Cons:
➤  It has outdated graphics. ALL Character models have low graphics even with ultra 
      settings.
      Character creation is lacking too.

➤  Literally every zone is lifeless and have low textureless graphics even with ultra settings.

➤  The game is said to be ""story heavy"" but the Majority of the cut-scenes are slow and without a voice actor.

➤  You know in some VERY old 2D games where you had to literally watch the screen and 
      wait til an NPC left the edge of 
      the screen before the cut-scene or gameplay continued? 
      Yeah.. ALL quests and cut-scenes are like this. I'm not exhaggerating.. 
          
          ➥  Talking to ALOT of NPC's makes them turn towards you and then they activate a 
                voiceless talking hand gesture 
                animation that lasts for like 2-3 seconds before you can proceed with 
                accepting/returning a quest. 
                Then you have to wait for ANOTHER animation that says ""Quest 
                accepted/completed"" to finish playing for 
                another 3-5 seconds to be able to continue playing the game.

➤  Combat is extremely repetitive and dull where you press 1, 2(combo), 3 (combo).. etc. 
      And guess what? You have to wait for a global ability cooldown for 1.5-2 seconds before being able to do the 
      follow-up combos to those 3 abilities. If the fight is long (which happens half of the time) you have to endure that 
      looooooong repetitive Attack(1), wait for CD, Attack(2), wait for CD... Attack(3), wait for CD combat gameplay.

➤  You can't use mounts in Cities which makes you run alot on foot.

➤  There's alot more Cons but can't think of more out the top of my head for now.
             
This game does NOT meet the positive reviews of the game, maybe it would've back when the game was released but it's extremely outdated today.",2021/07/01,3,3,0.433477401733398438,5

"The community mods are toxic and will give 1 month community bans over nothing, so watch what you say, even if you don't think it's wrong.

The community is the same, but at least they can't ban you. Don't talk to them and there wont be any issues. What ever you do, do NOT mention ANYTHING negative about FF14. You will be shunned, you will get hated and excluded, and if you're a content creator they will do anything to get you cancelled.

As for the game, it's pretty fun, solid game-play, story starts off dull but it gets better. Devs are very nice, have a good relationship with their community and listens to feedback, although perhaps a bit naïve when it comes to the NA/EU community by enabling all this toxicity.

And now I have an addiction XD.

This is one of the most fun games I've played in a while. It's complicated and intimidating at first, but it really does give you a lot of freedom to play how you want to play. Everything is customizable, you don't have to use third party programs to tweak your HUD so that's a huge plus; the character creation is so much fun, there's a huge variety of classes to pick from ranging from simple and beginner friendly to complex and challenging for veteran players. The worlds are so developed and are gorgeous, the score is fantastic, and the community is AMAZING. Of course no game is perfect, but all in all, I don't regret a thing.

"One of the greatest games in the MMORPG genre sure it has a monthly fee but the developers deliver tons and tons of content each month making it well worth your money and effort to play this game, it also has alot of replayability since any 1 character can play any class at any single time and having 1 high lvl class helps your low lvl classes lvl up much faster.
Personally I already have 6 lvl 50+ classes giving me tons of exp bonuses for my other low lvl classes.
You can do just about anything in this game, tons of worker classes even fishing xD and they all have their own distinct quest lines to follow.
Also if you're High lvl and you want to do dungeons with your friends who are low lvl they have a Sync system that virtually lowers your lvl enough to the default necesary for said dungeon that way you cant ""Break"" the dungeon just cause you were a higher lvl.
Even former WOW players love this game, its just that good.
The full controller support is a definite bonus since I used to play it on my PS3 and was accustomed to the controls there now im on PC and I can still use my controller.

Along the way you have visions, and engage in epic multi staged battles for the fate of the world. The characters are well enough developed that you come to care about what happens to them. The class story intertwines nicely with the main story at times, creating some pretty epic scenes. The forrests of Gridania and the oceans of Limsa Limonsa are beatiful.

I just want to play, man ! 

The main story quest isn´t even enjoyable. If you think killing 200 monsters in a quest in any other MMO is boring you came to the wrong place. This game offers nothing but running from point A to B to C to D reading tons of non-synchronized terrible dialogue.

"Well, if my hours played aren't an indicator... There is a LOT to do in this game, an overwhelming amount, to be honest. I feel *somewhat* okay with what I accomplished in 750+ hours. As time goes on the older content continues to become harder and harder to complete, and as with all MMO's, will never get better. If you want to do everything this game has to offer its impossible, and for some that may deter you. It bothers me but not enough to quit. Now, with that in mind, I spent the grand majority of my time in this game solo. I joined a free company here and there as I drifted around servers, and they're how you complete the old content if you've got a good one. 

It's a slog, it's an MMO. It's a LOT of work, but the reward system is as addicting as any other. If you NEED to play an MMO,  and have played one before to the point you get the majority of MMO mechanics, this is your next MMO. It's like ""intermediate"" level in terms of MMO. WoW was easy as crap, Mortal Online is about as hard as it gets, this sits clean somewhere between them. This is one of the *BIG* MMO's out there.

"Simply put this is the best MMO currently on the market.

Why should you play this over other MMOs?

This game is about the player. You create your character and you choose to do what you want.

That is not to say that you can change the story, there is a main storyline that you have to follow and you have no choice over what happens in the story. But you can choose to play or change your character how you want.

You can do everything on a single character, there is no point in alts.

Want to be a Paladin? Equip a sword and shield and now you're a paladin.
Want to blow up stuff with fireballs? Equip a black mage staff and now you cast fireballs,.

Each job (class) has its own level and you can level all of them as you choose.
Crafters are the same and level like any other real class.

There is just a TON of content you can do.

Lots of things to collect, mounts, pets, glamour armor and weapons, achievements, player housing.
Game is mostly about PVE but there are PVP battlegrounds that you can play.

All content in the game is scaleable from the start, a higher level player can join his friends in dungeons and his stats and level will scale down so that content always offer the correct challenge.

A ton of things in the game are just convenient, you don't feel like systems are badly designed or that its just a cash grab like a lot of other MMOs.

Game is really booming with new players as well right now.",2021/06/28,1,0,0.504999995231628418,0

"It's basically retail WoW except at the moment it's cool to hate Blizzard because they abandon systems and make you start over too frequently.  The first and second dungeons were facerolled; I tanked.  The first dungeon I used combos, taunts and aggro generating abilities pulling much more than I probably should have.  There was no fear of  being stunned, silenced, over pulling, running out of resources (think mana or rage).  For the second dungeon, I did none of what a tank should do and didn't come close to a wipe.  

There is no strategy at all and no danger of losing when leveling making it very boring.  If you're not going to make leveling somewhat of a challenge then just get rid of levels and start everyone at max.  It seems like you can take all the professions and are not limited at all.  You can change classes/spec whenever you want provided you started the quests for it and have that classes weapon (basically a lvl 1 quest).  I don't see how there is anything to this game...it's similar to every WoW theme park MMO before it.  

If you buy this game thinking you are going to find greener grass than retail then you'll basically find the same grass.  Leaving classic WoW for this?  Well, the grass on the FF14 side of the fence is pretty much dead .  Classic might not be as much of a challenge as once thought but this entire game is easy mode and far more casual than classic ever was.  

This whole wave of streamers and youtube personalities are either engaging in some kind of coordinated, subversive marketing paid for by Square-Enix or they have bought into the marketing themselves without realizing it for free.  This isn't a Final Fantasy game...it's retail WoW with a FF skin.

"I originally bought this game to play with my bf after weeks of him trying to convince me to since we're both long distance, but I didn't think I'd like it much since I didn't like the whole fighting aspect of the game. He assured me that there's more than fighting and that I would love this game (he was right). I did have a few issues while registering my account like the authentication not working right and not being able to login to my Square Enix account, but nothing a simple google search couldn't fix. After all the issues were solved and the game was downloaded, I spent nearly 2 hours alone just trying to pick a solid character design I and ended up going with a pink haired Miqo'te!! I picked WHM as my first class and though the base game is boring itself, the expansions afterwards make up for it. I spent time going through the MSQ before burning myself out for a bit. I didn't play for about two months, then I came back and found myself only staying in Limsa to interact with people and make new friends. I put my MSQ on pause and while spending most of my time in Limsa, I developed a fantasia addiction. My FC members would joke around about my lil fantasia addiction and we'd all have harmless fun, which I enjoy a lot. I like games that give you the option to be involved in a social setting or to choose not to interact and be involved at all. You can level so many different classes, buy a house (at the risk of your own mental and physical health), be social in limsa, worry about glamours, and even g@mble your life savings away in the Gold Saucer in Uldah. It's all up to your personal choice, I just know I've met so many great people while playing this game and I wouldn't change that for anything. I can never play many games for very long without getting bored, but I can always play this and will always come back to FFXIV no matter what <3 :)",2021/06/28,1,0,0,0
"I feel like I can write at least a small review with 5 thousand hours in the game so here we go. 

Tldr: It's great, the best mmo in my opinion out there. Good music, dungeons, story and awesome community. Rocky start but starts to get better after the first expansion.

Alright so let's start with the base and go up. A Real Reborn, the base game you get is easily the longest and grueling at times. Quests that make you go fetch things from A to B, talk to this person etc. However, it still has some good points. 
    -The experience you get from doing the main story quests can keep you up to date for dungeon requirements. Some even give you gear so you don't need to throw your gil (In game currency) at the Market Board (player shop). 
   -Before the first dungeon you get the choice of having a tutorial on the basics of your current role (Tank, Healer or DPS.). Each training focuses on the general tasks your role does. The rewards you get are gear that lasts until lvl 20 and a ring that grants you XP until lvl 25 or lvl 30.
   -When you reach lvl 20-ish it starts to open up its world by having you travel around the continent. This is where you get some world building lore, the struggles of each nation, how the events prior to your arrival transpired and affected them along with some politics. 
   -It's beginner raids are new player friendly. Instead of having 8 people you have 4 which can be a good thing. 

There are other good points out there but I will let you decide on them. Now, with ARR done, let's give a look at what is to come. Spoiler free of course. 
   The first expansion, Heavensward, introduces new things to the fray like mechanics, locations and it starts the addition of flying in each zone with whatever mount you want! Aside from those it features an engaging soundtrack that changes with each phase making the fights more fun and epic. Worthy of the title you have been bestowed upon back in A Real Reborn. What it also brings are 3 new classes: Dark Knight, Astrologian and Machinist. All three are accessible once you start the Heavensward expansion but start at a lower level than its entry level. 
  -Dark Knight: A tank class that is seen edgy due to its use of ""inner darkness of your soul"" but a fun one and useful. 
  - Astrologian: You use the stars and tarot cards to heal and buff your allies. Another fun class, especially if you enjoy multitasking. 
  -Machinist: A ranged physical dps that uses guns and turrets. It's fairly simple to play as and can get powerful later on. 
Heavensward is seen as one of the best of the currently 3 expansions because of its story and I am inclined to agree. After finishing A Real Reborn, Heavensward will leave you very satisfied with how the game evolved. But it does not end there.

With Heavensward out of the way, Stormblood! Like before, it adds new mechanics and music along with two new areas, both having zones that you can enable flying in. With it comes 2 new classes this time, both DPS. 
  -Red Mage: Your fencer mage that uses both black and white magic to fight and support their allies. Heal and bring back your allies like a semi-healer in battles or focus on dealing damage while looking stylish! It's part of their persona. 
  -Samurai: Your sword wielding fighter from the Far East, which some of you might laugh at because of its name. Simple in gameplay but once you reach a higher level and learn its gimmicks you can see yourself dishing out large amounts of damage.
Stormblood is considered the good-ish one of the trio. I see it as an expansion that deviates a bit from the action of Heavensward and goes deeper in terms of other topics. 

And now, the latest expansion. Shadowbringers!
This expansion was one that left many players with their mouth agaped, sat at the edge of their seat and with their heart clenched. I shall leave the reasons to you! Minor advice: Buckle up. Things go to another level. As before, new zones with unlockable flying.
 Shadowbringers also brings to the fold 2 new classes: Gunbreaker and Dancer. A tank and a DPS. 
  -Gunbreaker: The small brother of Warrior that focuses on swift movements and big damage. It's skills are designed for fast gameplay, the player having 3 sets of combos: One for gathering ""Cartridges"" followed by a combo that uses a cartridge and another one that uses the 2nd combo. Confused? So was I but it comes around. A good description would be: Devil May Cry but tab target style. 
  -Dancer: It does what its name implies. With a combo that is half dependent on RNG, the dancer swoops in with its buff by performing steps with their Dance Partner, increasing both of their damage as the timer goes down. At later levels you can buff the party members around yourself, also increasing their damage. With their Dance Partner they can buff and heal each other and those around them. 


Now for another part of this review. You have noticed that I have mentioned repeatedly that you can fly, yes? Well that is because I have been saving words for this segment!
 
World Building! 

Each expansion gives the players new elements to the lore behind the universe of FFXIV. From the customs of each area and its people to civilizations long past to heroes of eld and gods once worshiped. The game introduces this through its story and many other quests. 

Questing! 

From Heanvensward and onward there is a trend that has been established with how the Main Quests work. It's pacing can be like this: First quest with the entry level is the introduction of the expansion followed by the next level being a dungeon you go in. The next quest can involve a solo instance where you fight along side NPC's in a revisited dungeon or a specially made area for it. And then another dungeon or trial. The cycle repeats like this to keep the player engaged and not go through another ARR slogfest.

Music!

The music is by far the best in my opinion. The composer, Masayoshi Soken, has a clear grasp on what to implement in this category so the player can enjoy doing the content. From slow motifs to full on pieces in which make you question yourself if you are in a battle of life or death or at an opera/concert. Many fall in love with the music in it and choose to do content because of it! Myself included. 

Community!
It has been said a lot of times that the community of FFXIV is really welcoming and well mannered. I stand to agree to that but I won't let it be sugarcoated that much. We have problems like many other MMO's and games that have you play with real people have. If I would be correct to assume, the reason behind this big point that has been brought so many times is because we choose to be kind because the developers are also kind. It's a paying forward sort of deal. At least that is how I see it.


And that is all I can think of. If you have read this far, thank you for your time! I hope this review will be at least helpful in getting an image on how the game is like and if you want to try it. Hope to see you lads and lasses in the game! And most importantly, have an awesome day!",2021/06/28,546,12,0.955303430557250977,7

"Can I recommend the game? Yes, ofcourse I can.  But not to just everyone. 

There are many people who hate feeling chained down by a game, and its tutorials and start-up requirements - and this game is absolutely full of that sort of nonsense. 

It will take you several hours to learn to navigate basic map systems, Some classes are locked behind weird requirements, like being able to choose the Rogue class requires you to have a level 10 character in game first. 

The level 1-50 main story content is such a slog, and used to be even worse - thankfully in the last year they've halved the amount you have to tread through but UGH.    At-least have some interesting story when going through it.  It's not til level 30 it starts to get even remotely interesting in the story, and even that's riddled with tons of filler.

I've introduced 3 friends to the game, and all of them are having major struggles because it's difficult to play together and do things as a team until level 16+. And even then, you have to keep splitting up to do class quests.

Not to mention the IMMENSE amount of ""Go here, come back. Go there. Come back"" questing.  It's not fun to run outside of town for 3 minutes to kill some rats and then run back through town and go up an elevator, all causing 3 loading screens.   You spend so much time walking the same path, just to see an NPC say ""Hah. good work. Now go do that again but with THIS enemy!""   

The later quests like, level 35+ are good.  But that intro content DEFINITELY  needs work.

And please, for the love of all that is holy, please allow a vote-to-skip option for the Main Story Roulette. Sitting down for basically a 45  minute movie is not what a quick roulette finder is for. 



Alright, rant out of the way,

The positives of this game include:

- A wide variety of dungeons - with each including their own threats in both environment and mobs to fight, making them truly unique from eachother. Complete with traps, puzzles, and complicating boss fights if you're new to them. 

- Many classes, all of which can be played on the same character - with plenty of inventory space for multiple sets of armor that is separate from your normal inventory.

- Professions, they're just like classes, complete with their own quests and stories and equipment. You truly are made to feel like a student of your craft.

- Stunning visual effects, though, some of you will need to tweak these to be less striking - especially in raiding scenarios.

- Gorgeous music, as can be expected from a FF game.

 - Fantastic and enjoyable boss fights in both dungeons and Raids, and world (fate) bosses.

 - Lots of minigames to enjoy in the Golden Saucer casino, all-though I'm looking forward to there being more added to it.

 - Mounts and pets, plenty of them, and all mounts can fly. (though, don't expect the same kinda flight freedom as in WoW, because hitting invisible barriers of the zone is really annoying.)",2021/06/27,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0

I've played many MMO's over the years, and this one is hands down the bottom of the barrel, desperately trying to copy WoW's formula without giving it any kind of soul or identity to set it apart from the other.

To put it in perspective, you spend your first 50+ hours literally doing nothing but mailman quests, and that's 50 hours with someone flying me around to do them and it still takes that long. That's not okay, and the content doesn't get ANY better after that. For example: After you do the game's first bulk of content, you have to do MORE THAN SEVENTY QUESTS to start progressing through the game again.

S E V E N T Y .

BEFORE you can progress again. That's another 20+ hours of literally mailman quests with a couple dungeons sprinkled here and there. The real kicker? The devs KNOW this part of the game is so bad that they, instead of FIXING it, offer a PAID skip for it.

Speaking of dungeons, most that you will do cap your level to the dungeon's recommended level. Which would be fine if they didn't take new spells away from you that you've just learned. What's the point of progressing, then? Higher numbers, I guess? Because the content in the game from what I've seen (Savage difficulty is this game's version of mythic raids in WoW, and are essentially heroic difficulty in WoW by comparison) is insultingly easy.

I played this long because I kept getting PROMISED the game was ""going to get better"" and ""It's so much more fun"" after I slog through through the mind-numbing first 50+ hours. I was obviously lied to.

Thing is, other MMO's were at least somewhat captivating from the very beginning. They were engaging even with only a couple spells/abilities at your disposal. This? It's so painfully slow paced, extremely stiff, and clunky as all hell. The GCD is something like three seconds long. A whopping three seconds of waiting to use another ability. You get spell/ability speed as a stat that lessens it, but the impact isn't enough to make a difference until max level (80) from what I've read up.

If you manage to drag yourself through the ""vanilla"" game, so to speak, you see that the devs took a slight turn and tried to mimic WoW's quests - but without adding actual flavor or variety. At level 54, I was doing the exact same things as I was at level 1, without any increase in difficulty, hardly a change in rotation, or meaningful impact on my character.

I guess if you want to pay $15 for a giant weeb movie (because there are an annoying amount of extremely long, and unvoiced cutscenes), it's your wet dream, but for those that are sensible in realizing how soulless this game actually is, pass it up and never look back.

This is the worst MMO I have ever played, and I honestly feel bad for those of you who have fooled yourselves into thinking this is at all an acceptable alternative to so many others out there that have done it better than this game ever will.",2021/06/27,7,2,0.321854144334793091,0

"An absolute Masterpiece made from love, a respect for the fans and a willingness to listen and learn from mistakes - If you liked FF7, 8, 9 and 10 then you will very much like this game, if like me you dont rush, soak in all the story, scenery, lore,  fights and such then you will LOVE this game. When i played FF7 back in 97 i dreamed of World of Warcraft but in the FF world,  I downloaded Realm Reborn and Heavensword for free as you can play it all up to lvl 60 but not level any higher, I played 59 hours and got to lvl 34....... the standard edition starter pack and Shadowlands expansion went on sale for £17 (all on steam) and I insta bought it along with the preorder to End Walker, I then went onto the site for the game and purchased every collectors edition supliment pack via the site making the entire game the collectors edition with all the pets mounts etc. Total cost £105............im seriously considering dropping some more to get Cloud's bike as a mount after finding out that indeed it has the chase scene music directly ripped from FF7 as you ride along (all mounts have music and various ones can carry 1-2-4 and 8 people).................... I urge everyone to download the game for free no matter what preference in games you have, apart from Path of Exile I cant think of another such no-brainer. :)",2021/06/26,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0

"5 out of 5

Pros:
The expansion packs are some of the best storytelling in the Final Fantasy (FF) franchise.  Well worth the time investment on their own.
Majority of the game outside of instances are solo content.  Solo players rejoice.
All classes can be played and swapped out instantly (outside of combat).
Once a certain quest is done you can take an NPC party into dungeons (not all instances can have them though).
In the later expansion packs all instances outside of raids can use the story NPC parties.  Solo players rejoice.
Glamour can be placed on armor to allow for a certain look instead of a piecemeal look.
Lots of classes to play and each has its own strengths and weaknesses.

Cons:
A Realm Reborn is a slog-fest to get through and outstays its welcome.
It can take a lot of time for DPS classes to find dungeon groups.
Instances from previous expansions and their unique currencies become obsolete once new stuff comes out and it can be difficult to get groups for them.
Game can be very grindy at times.

Other:
Raids are very technical and positional based.  If you can't keep up with that or remember the move sets then you won't have a fun time.  However, if that is your cup of tea then they are very fun.
Crafting can be hit or miss.  It has changed several times so I cannot comment on its current state.",2021/06/26,0,0,0,0

"Highly recommended for MMORPG fans with a love for the old FF games. While its a fresh world and has it's own story - that gets better over time with each expansion - it also has alot of the same flavour / tone of the earlier games in the FF series.

The community are surprisingly friendly and welcoming towards new players compared to other MMO's ive played. You'll be hard pressed to find people being obnoxious in your parties in FF, its a much more civil space than the likes of WoW.

With a hefty amount of content included in the Free Trial. I recommend giving this a go if your current MMO is feeling stale.",2021/06/26,0,0,0,0

"Got my house on my first camp, ez game.

But no for real, it's pretty hard to summarize in so few words about what feels so fresh about this compared with any other mmo. I'm not just a wow 'refugee' but moreso an MMO refugee. The genre has kinda been flat for decades now. 

Hell, Destiny 2 is an mmo in all but amount of players able to join together if you look at it for what it is. Ilvl gearing with repeated dungeons and pvp queuing as the main way to progress, stats and mechanics that NEED players to make in-depth videos about instead of y'know. Explaining such mechanics in the game. It feels like all but two stats are dead in that game. Quests are recolored and repeated for months and months.

FFxiv gave me that feeling of Metal Gear Solid V the phantom pain funnily enough. After playing so much triple A shlock, that game felt like a real video game and it was willing to be goofy and take the piss out of itself.

In that vein, you can't go wrong with a story with over 100 hours of content. As everyone says, the ARR experience is probably the worst out of it all, but if you just keep your head down and crank out the main story you'll fly through it faster than you think.

Beyond that, there's no infinite grind like Wow, you can just be done gearing for a patch cycle and instead worry about gearing up your other classes. The raids may not be as plentiful, but they're so much more artistically inspired and easier to read mechanically than most of Wows raids ever were. Everyone says PVP is suck and dead, but it's about as good as any other MMOs. Everyone just forming murderblobs and the first to lose too many fights is the loser.

RPG wise, the classes are simpler than classes from other mmos. Sure they have about as many buttons but you typically just have your single target rotation, aoe, the finisher combos of each as well as your assorted self/party buffs to make your life easier. crafter/gatherers also have actual 'rotations' as well and a lot more depth than say Warcraft, which is just a menu and single stock crafting animation. So many little side activities like the Gold Saucer (virtually just in-game Vegas), Maps which are extremely lucrative for gil and rare items, hunts and so much that would bog this already lengthy recommendation. To summarize, not like like a lot of others that remove half of the interesting stuff in hopes of making the incoming patches and expansions more appealing.

Finally, rp-wise is probably the strong suit. Even simple stuff like the transmog, they're willing to suspend fantasy for letting people make some truly goofy or awesome looking glamours. An actual wedding instance with player-center cutscenes and nice rewards for the newly betrothed. Housing being a perpetually added-to thing instead of a one-and-dump with Garrisons from Wow.

Sure sucks that housing is limited and ppl house camp for so many hours, but we'd have the opposite problem of nobody caring like BDO because it's all phased and constantly cycling through whos house is showing. The upcoming island in Endwalker should hopefully alleviate some of the want.

Give the free version a go. Level 40 is about when the classes really start to open up ability wise, and if you skip half of the less important cutscenes, you could be there in about two days play or so if your a super mmo-savvy chud. I missed a lot even here, but if you can't even bear through that much then you probably don't have the MMO or RPG itch anymore and that's alright.

I say OR RPG because, hey it actually feels like one, where the mechanics of the end-game grind doesnt actually drown out all the experiences before it.

"Security system is terrible. The 'one time passwords' that have some layer of added security can come up wrong locking you out of your own account. The support centre closes at 5pm UK time so if you work then you wont be able to get help until the next day. Really poor design in authentication app. Blizzards is much better in every way. The added bonus that with blizzards it allows you to accept a login rather than to be forced to type in a password that has every chance of being incorrect. 

*Edit.

I still believe Square Enix make it incredibly difficult to purchase the game, dlc, etc. I honestly have no idea if I should buy endwalker via square enix store or steam and if choosing wrong will mess things up.

However, as much as SE really need to adjust accessibility and ease of purchase, the game itself is superb and has something for everyone. Rich story, interesting dungeons, trials, raids etc, cool ass mounts, glamour (transmog), fun and intricate crafting, beautiful landscapes and detailed classes/jobs.

"One of the things I love most about FF XIV is just the fact that they've made a world that you want to exist in.  It's not a constant race for item level or player power.  Those factors are there, but so many people are just content to see the story, hang around major cities dancing and listening to bards play music, or throw big dance parties in player housing.  It gives players an interesting world and tells them to go have fun however they want.  It's honestly what has always made MMOs fun and what so many have forgotten about recently.",2021/06/25,0,0,0,0

"Is it the best MMORPG ever? Depends on your personal taste really, but the game is objectivelly good enough to have that discussion and that says a lot. Easier question is, is the game worth the money? Well, you get A Realm Reborn and Heavensward with one month of game time for 10 euro and the game time itself is worth more than that :D. The fact you are not even subbed yet and you don't own Stormblood and Shadowbringers doesn't limit you in any meaningful way (unless you just HAVE TO be bunny girl :D, that requires Shadowbringers) and you can experience more than enough of the game to decide, if you want to buy the latest expac and sub way later down the road. So yes, I think it is the easiest choice ever to buy this starter pack and get into the game if you like MMORPGs, especially if you are into WoW or SWTOR, which are in many ways very similar and FF XIV just seems to be doing all the same things, but better and then some - there is actually tons of original side content, other than the usual dungeon/raid/PvP thing.

"Final Fantasy 14 is bar none one of my favorite MMOs. Where most of them I usually bounce off and more or less never come back - even if I generally enjoy them, like Guild Wars 2 or Wildstar (RIP) - I always come back to FF14. Final Fantasy 14 has something for everyone, though it doesn't cater much to the ""hardcore"" crowd a-la World of Warcraft or other games that have seriously intense raiding scenes.

First and foremost, Final Fantasy 14 is a JRPG first, and an MMO second - there are lots of MMO qualities, obviously, but the game has a *very heavy* focus on story and immersion. The game wants you to feel like your character and immerse you in the world of Final Fantasy 14 - this has some pros and cons. Although it's nice to have a very story-focused MMO, it can be frustrating to have to play the story basically constantly to unlock or do anything for some players, and the story can sometimes feel very slow or oddly paced (especially in the vanilla game's story arc).

Second, Final Fantasy 14 has what's called a ""Job"" system - it essentially allows you to level every single class on a single character, while giving EXP boosts to characters that are lower level than your highest level class, encouraging you to multi-class and explore what you find fun. This extends to gathering and crafting jobs, which all interweave together in order to make cool and/or super useful gear.

Third, Final Fantasy 14 has been out for a *while*. The early game will feel a little crusty, and it will be super hammy acting, and it will be a little frustrating to get through - trust me when I say, it's so worth it to get through it. If you enjoy it even a little bit, you will eventually come out the other side into the super steamy-hot content that starts around the beginning of Heavensward, the first expansion (which comes free with the trial, coincidentally). A lot of the content in the vanilla game is outclassed heavily in the later parts of the game, to the point it feels so old compared to some of the Dungeons and Trials available in future areas.

Fourth, the dev team and producers give a shit. They care about player experience and they actually play the game regularly. This isn't like your Activision-Blizzard group where they only want to milk you for time and money.

Lastly, the community in the game is mostly comprised of very welcoming and kind people. The people in this game have formed a real, genuine companionship with one another and there's a lot of fun to be had just enjoying time with others, sitting around and talking. This can extend from just relaxing to planning Raids or Roleplaying, if that's more your speed. There is a lot of love in this game's playerbase and I cannot overstate how positive my experiences have been - there are always a few bad eggs, but my experience is so heavily weighted towards positivity that the moments that *were* bad stand out so much in the sea of good faith and companionship.

Give the game a chance. If you like it, you'll find a real place to enjoy some time off and relax - become immersed in the story, form a community of friends, and enjoy a truly great MMO experience.",2021/06/24,0,0,0,0
i came from a game called world of warcraft  when i started my journey there 15 years ago it was magical  you hung out with friends engaged in the world around you and truly felt like the people behind that magical world cared about you as a player over the years that magic faded away  i was lost  then a little bird told me about final fantasy i installed this game 20 hours ago and  emotions slammed  me  deep in my heart the  friendly community the way the story grabs at your very soul  the amount of exploration and freedom  final fantasy reminded me what a mmorpg really is  i would recommend this game to anyone even if you dont like to  do pvp or pve just craft and hang out with people in your player housing  decorate  and show off glamour <transmog>  hunt achievements mounts  and more  i would rate this game a  *100/10*,2021/06/24,0,0,0,0

Everything WoW does, Final Fantasy 14 does better. Final Fantasy 14 keeps the player numbers high not by random RNG on equipment, but by giving actually good, compelling content. Final Fantasy 14's storyline is amazing and not a total clusterfuck. Final Fantasy 14 has a fairly good community. Final Fantasy 14 is actually fun.

If you play WoW, or ever enjoyed playing WoW, I would strongly consider playing Final Fantasy 14 instead. There's a reason WoW is hemorrhaging players, while FF14's player count simply continues to rise. It is, by far, the superior choice.",2021/06/24,0,0,0,0

"This game introduces a wonderful beautiful world to the player, and allows them to create a character that fits inside their fantasy setting of Final Fantasy world.

Here are my issues:
 - for a story game there is so much dialog but nothing has voice acting, requiring reading a very small dialog window crammed with text
 - if the cat people thing doesn't throw you off as a western MMORPG player playing an eastern game, the theme itself will. You go from a fantasical city to killing bugs with two spells.
 - the combat itself felt like it had potential but was a dry cut and paste of WoW: it felt uninspired and like it was formuliac of WoW which stole it from an even older game - everquest
 - I can't escape this feeling that the character I want to play as, I cant seem to create, based on the delicate races and classes they have available. The strong steady brutish archetype or cunning dark scary caster type just seems impossible to make in this fairy world.

With the exception of your basic shops, repairs, and a handful of merchants; no more trying to learn new cities among changing classes/jobs. This is one of many QOL changes that i absolutely adore. 
Another noteworthy mention, traveling. Absolutely effortless. Upon visiting any new territory or quest hub as the MSQ progresses, you simply attune to the respective crystals and you can fast travel to any of them for a negligible fee. 
All in all I am very happy thus far, (currently main job Black Mage/level 50) and not letting up any time soon.

"My prior personal experience to MMORPG's wasn't what I'd call good. I'd previously only played titles like Runescape and Perfect World International, which both were not my kind of experience I wanted with an MMO. I remained skeptical about playing FFXIV, but playing the very generous free trial has given me a whole new standard to which I'll be comparing MMO's in the future as well as a much firmer grasp on what I actually want and value in an MMO that I didn't have before. Instead of going into some huge thing of me trying to be analytical, this is what really sold me on this game more than anything else:

The game, even in its free trial, looked at me and told me that I could make my one character, take my time, and at my own pace pick up and learn any and every class I wanted. Without having several characters to keep track of for several different things or feeling like I'm starting 100% from scratch any time I want to try something fresh, I was given the freedom to try out any and all 13 combat classes, any of the 3 gatherer classes, any of the 8 crafter classes, and whatever you want to call Blue Mage. And because I had the choice, I got to proactively and fearlessly pursue basically everything. That freedom helped me really come to love playing this game. Even now at 1600+ hours, I'm still dipping into new content I've never touched before, and having a fun time doing it.",2021/06/23,3,0,0.540004074573516846,0

"I switched over from WoW because of the massive gap between 9.0 and 9.1, and getting generally burned out. FFXIV is excellent and I'm really enjoying it. The music and story are front and center, in true FF fashion. You have to go through main story quests to unlock long distance travel and dungeons for example. 

There is a lot I can say here but to be brief: ARR (that's level 1-50 content) is decent and then it only gets better from there. It's a game that somehow seems to keep getting better and better the further you get. SB (level -70-80) content is a league ahead of the rest, and judging by the trailer for the next expansion, it's about to get even better.

Some basic MMO specific info:

They do have typical dungeons and raids, with a tank, a healer, and 2 dps.

Queues for dungeons are typically 5 mins

They also have raids, they come in 2 difficulties, roughly equal to Normal and Mythic from WoW

All content from all expansions is viable at level cap. Think of it as permanent time-walking if you're coming from WoW, but you will get tokens that are viable for endgame gear

They have single boss fights (a bit like World Bosses in WoW) that they call trials, and those start early, like level 20 ish, and also scale up to end game

PvP I haven't tried yet, but I'm told this is not the MMO for you if you're into PvP, try Guild Wars 2 instead.

Yes there are mounts and that includes flying mounts. They have all the other usual collectibles as well, and achievements, titles, /dance emotes... nothing seems to be missing in the 'casual' category

Community is probably better here than in any MMO. New players will have a 'sprout' icon next to their name, and veteran players have incentives for helping you out. It's a brilliant system; they have really cultivated a friendly community by design. And somehow I see less ""weebs"" and ""ERP"" types here than in WoW, despite what you'd expect from a game where one of the playable races is cat-people and FF tends to attract anime fans. People are surprisingly ""normal"" here

Anyway, I say give it a shot. It's a fantastic game with a lot of great players.",2021/06/21,1,0,0,0
"Game is great. Started last December. Love Final Fantasy titles. Was not sure it is possible to keep that vibe in MMO so I avoided this title. Was so wrong. Its basically Final Fantasy game where you can play with other people. 

Social options are better than on some social-focused MMOs. Its the first game (for me at least) where your character actually looks at NPCs and other players in their face while talking to them! A lot of small things like that just make it my favorite game right now. Great gameplay, fun dungeons, awesome Trials and Raids, best end game cycle I have ever experienced in any MMO. And soundtrack is just... something special. Soken is a genius.

Everything is more convenient and the way the story grow is really amazing. I've just finished all the added story content in ARR and just about to progress into the next expansion. I will have to say even just playing this MMO for its story line is worth it. Initial story is not bad but as when you pull it through, the story just keep getting better.

"Overall Impressions: Final Fantasy XIV is able to deliver a genuine MMO experience and a RPG experience all in the same game. The story driven narrative plays out similar to a JRPG and you can expect over 150+ hours of the main story. Side stories adds to the immersion and the world building established by the writers and reinforces the diverse world of Eorzea. Almost all activities outside of the main story can be enjoyed in a multiplayer experience. From 4-man content like dungeons to 8-man content like trials or raids to 24 man content like alliance raids, this game will push you to play with others and reinforces the ""MMO"" in mmorpg. Square Enix also introduced a lot of miscellaneous activities that gives the players a fresh and novel experience such as deep dungeons, Eureka, and Bozja.

For casual gamers, this game offers a relax pacing. Extreme trials, normal raids, alliance raids, relic content can all be beaten by gamers of any skill level. Developers will often introduce new game content that encourages players to rerun older content such a mount farming, relic questline, relic farming, etc, so old content is never truly phased out of existence. PVE content is also not the only facet of this game. Crafting and gathering has an arguably larger percentage of player participation than raiding and FFXIV players will often say that ""housing is the true endgame"".",2021/06/21,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0

"I went into this game for two reasons: it has NieR: Automata raids and I was told I could summon Bahamut. I am up to the NieR raids and am too excited to start them. Bahamut was underwhelming and I switched from Summoner to Dark Knight. I love Dark Knight, and so many other jobs like Astrologian. This game has been an incredible and unforgettable experience.

 I started 2 months ago and now sit at the end of Shadowbringers, eagerly awaiting Endwalker. The amount of quests, the glamour system, gameplay loops that get more complex over time, incredible wealth of dungeon/raid/side content, amazing music, breathtaking environments, carefully crafted narratives with CONSISTENTLY GOOD dialogue, magnificent character designs, an inspiring development team that has worked themselves out of failure and debt to build an epic ahead of its time, and most importantly, an altruistic and genuine community full of people who have a great outlook on life and want to make sure you have one, too. 

This game has been downright therapeutic for me, especially with everything I've gone through for the past almost 2 years of my life now.

"If u Liked to play one of them: Tera, Blade and Soul or Aion.. not recommending to even try this


1. Literally no character ccustomization
2. Story is trash... feels like u go to book not npc read alot of text (no voice) and literally the setting in char.. customization where u had to pick ur voice sound is totally useless cuz u can hear it prbl when u char dies lol
3. Combat system ---> stay afk spam 1 skill --- mob dies... and char controlling is so bad lol its feels like u playing strategy game in 3D even if u have keyboard its almost useless for anything expect mowing from one book to another (i mean quest npc)...
4. summoner class is literally SHI.... ur summon early game no dmg ur other skills only debuffs which literally no dmg u cant 
cast anything whille mowing so early game u have only one normal skill which is stay afk spam 1 on keyboard and heal urself  its like u r 1 does 1000 dmg while other 6 skills and does 10hp dmg on 3sec interval so if mob has 3k hp its better to  spam first skill 3 times than waste the same time to cast other spell and get 100x lower dmg
5. this game has no graphics even potato laptop can play this thats prbl the only reasson why ppl playing this sh... its literally runescape with albion online grpahics
6. Most hilarious part in this game which i saw was when char was talking with npc and i can read what was he saying and the game then showed how my char lips mowed but no sound and not even text what my char said lol...
7. U have to pay monthly to play this game but u STILL HAVE TO ""BUY"" EXPANSIONS... to get more reading content
8. If u want ur char to look a litlle bit more than a wood from tree u have to pay 18$ for costume
9. no char physics + no boobs on chars
10. Everything about this game feels like playing runescape in 2007 on exploler browser... 


Not recommending to buy but ofc u can try it by downloading they official launcher and trying to play by using 30days free trial

However, taking the chance on it was the best thing I could have done. I found a FC of people I love as well as found some of my best friends through the game. The story and graphics are incredible, and I can only say that if you are worried about playing the game because of the same reasons I did, don't be.

"EDIT:  I just learned this game has a bot problem that they have no intention of fixing because it dates back as far as 2013 from what I've read and I just saw it still happens today. So if bot accounts don't bother you then great. If it does bother you then you're out of luck because they're here to stay.

This is just sad, almost 8 years and they can't find a single way to stop people from using bots.

I love the game, just taking my time doing quests and leveling jobs. I'm personally not a fan loot roles in dungeons, I hate the very idea of rolling dice to see if I win some loot or not. This feels too much like gambling.

If you're going to force people to do dungeons the least you can do is give the option to pass on all loot for the instance.

Player housing is just about impossible for new players from what I've read it's actually Limited Player Housing, if the slots are taken you can't get one even if you have the gil which again I've read seems like it goes up and down something between 100-500mil (I hope that is wrong).

Just getting that kind of gil means it's mandatory to grind for whatever is worth enough gil to sell on this games version of an auction house at that time.Thing is everyone else is already doing this so good luck. If you want player housing that actually allows new and old players to own then ESO has that.

Overall it's a great game. I enjoy the leveling, questing, music, the visuals. Just not the dungeons, bots or player housing.",2021/06/18,0,0,0,0

The job system is also incredible!  It has taken me a while to get the hang of it and I am still not sure I have done that well.  There is just an endless amount of things to do.

"If you have played any MMO and enjoyed it, you will like FFXIV. I am not kidding. It has something for everyone.

I came in hating story-driven games. I skip every cutscene because this entire story is lame to me. With that said, I still adore this game so far. The mini-raid boss mechanic called Fates is my favorite. Nothing like stopping my quest real quick to fight a boss with a dozen other people my level for aight XP. I also really like the fishing, lol.

I am level 20 as of this review, I will come back and update it later.

**********EDIT*************
Just hit level 50. I still agree with everything I said previously. The only thing I hate is the 2.5s Global Cooldown on spells, especially as a black mage.... but you do get used to it. Hate is a strong word, dislike is closer to how I feel about GCD.

Fates are still amazing, and one of my favorite parts. They just give so much xp for the time put in. 

The 46-49 hump needs a lot of work, but dungeons give half your xp bar or more in XP even at level 50, so to call it a grind is a stretch, but it is a stark difference from the blazing fast leveling from story quests. For those who don't know there is a gap of quests after level 46, you need to get to 49 to continue. I recommend  just do the level 44 and 47 dungeons twice each and bam your 49 or 50 and past the hump.

I started dreaming about combo interactions as I just started Samurai. That is how engrossing this game is. 

I adore it, and I think I have put in enough time to safely say I am here to stay. You won me over, community. 

Oh forgot to add, there are also a ton of people willing to help. The whole Sprout/Mentor thing was a stroke of genius and tells you exactly who to go to for aid. Google the icons for Mentors so you know what to look for. Trust me.


EDIT 2: 114 HOURS IN BOYS. Still goin strong, I am lvl 58, the story xp slows down considerably compared to the beginning, but the dungeons are just as cool and nothing seems monotonous. I am so looking forward to 60 for Ishgard Restoration and my poetic gear. THIS GAME IS LIKE CRACK IT CONSUMES ME",2021/06/18,1,0,0.500171780586242676,0

"World of Warcraft refugee here.

I've been playing World of Warcraft for quite some time, and with quite some time I mean a few darn years. 
I am so used to that game that any other game just seems to dogshiz compared to it. 
Due to Blizzard having such a delay in releasing their content with their latest expansion I've decided to give Final Fantasy XIV Online a try.

Expectations weren't that high, as I am just trying to look for a game I want to play due to WoW boring the living hell out of me.
It entirely surprised me how much content this game has to offer. I don't even know where to get started with this; so let's start with the character creation.

OPTIONS!  So many options, More than WoW I'd say at this point. You can mix and morph stuff you want, colours and haircuts. Facial structures and all types of dazzle wazzle.
I am not much of a weeb myself but I already took a liking to the game from the get-go.

After creating my character and entering the game, and learning that I can play -any- class on this character, makes me have 0 need for an alt; at least. As far as my game knowledge goes, Which is perfect for someone like me.

The Playerbase is SUPER friendly. Me and a buddy dinged lvl 50 and some random guy came over and told us about the game and introduced us to so much stuff, helped explain a lot and answered a lot of questions. Even invited us to a chat for new players where we can ask all our questions.

The combat by far is something I like. Though I am playing on NA servers while I myself am EU, the delay is there. But it is not that noticable. It's rather smooth and enjoyable.

The fact this game doesn't charge you your entire savings to rename or change character appearance is also a massive bonus compared to World of Warcraft.

Unfortunately; due to having the ""The Road to lvl 70"" Buff, we aren't really able to play the game fully, we're mainly just racing through the Main Story Questline, and are by far a few levels ahead of it!

Don't really have to add much other than, 31+ hours in and I am having a -blast-",2021/06/18,5,0,0.568473339080810547,0

Remember in wow when getting an end game item felt rewarding and satisfying ? Here you'll get tons of stuff that feel weightless and pointless, it's all about glamours and who builds the better looking whores for others to jerk off to in your free company house(guild).

"Is this one of the better MMOs? Not in my opinion, but it isn't without charm and a certain appeal. If it were possible to give FFXIV a ""so-so"" rating that would be my choice. What did I like about the game?

The ability to play every class on one character
Large game world
Plenty to do
Fully-fleshed crafting system

What I didn't like about FFXIV.

Inventory space is pathetic.
Inability to mail items to other characters on the same account/share resources between them
A dedicated crafter is not possible --- in order to use a mount and access more inventory space for a crafter, you have to run at least one combat class
Poorly articulated quests... some are downright confusing.
Confusing cosmetic system
Overpriced in-game purchases compared to other MMOs

I honestly can't recommend FFXIV, but it isn't the worst MMO out there by any means.

"First, my credentials.  I have played most Final Fantasy games and own every Final Fantasy game available on Steam except for XI and Dissidia.

Do NOT buy the starter edition.  You need to get a free trial account in order to play for free.  While it does have an expansive free trial, if you give them any money, your account will be locked unless you pay a subscription fee.  If you aren't finished with all of the content that's available in the Free Trial and are only interested in playing that, you will still have to pay.  Of course you can always make a second account to take advantage of the free trial.  This is obviously a great design choice.

My next point will be on the story.  I have heard so much about how great the story is in this game.  I'm currently level 38 focusing on the Main Scenario Quest.  The main story so far seems to be about protecting the world from beings called Primals.  I will go over how the story goes.

In order to figure out how to get to a Primal, we must first get some supplies.  We have to go get cheese.  We have to get wine.  We have to kill a creature to use as bait to kill a larger animal.  We must get meat from the animal.  This is so the people that have the information we need can have a banquet.  I am not kidding, I am not exaggerating.  This is the beautiful, amazing, best story ever.

This has been for 38 levels.  This is neither fun nor interesting.  I'm still playing, I'll update this as needed.",2021/06/17,0,0,0.398550719022750854,0

"Of the time spent in here, I can honestly say it has been the best MMO Ive played to date. It isn't a perfect game, nor does it have to be. I can recall countless memories across the years that this game has been able to provide to me. And a lot of times, it is memories that are made from the people.

I for one enjoyed the story, and it has some pretty memorable and heart-wrenching moments. But many my good times come from the people here. Events my friends and I would make for ourselves. Done it all from RPing, crafting/gathering, glamouring, home decorating, market playing, dungeon running, music performing, raiding, treasure hunting, free company leading, PvPing, Main Story Questing, map exploring, trial farming, and so on. This game provides so much content to spend time with friends partaking in.

Unpopular opinion, but I really enjoyed the PvP. Is it perfect? No. It could do with some tweaks. Both to classes and more PvP types/maps. But the sheer amount of good times, from dueling with friends and player hosted tournaments, to the chaotic clashes in frontline, to the intense bouts of FEAST.

 FFXIV has one of the most welcoming communities I've seen in an MMO. Sure, there are bad apples. But fewer and further between (Aether). I highly recommend giving the free trial a shot at the very least for folk on the fence based on the subscription. Good hunting!~",2021/06/17,0,0,0,0

"If you want a MMO that provides a single player experience with some group content in the form of raids, dungeons, trails, etc. Then this is for you. If you are a ""nothing matters but the raiding"" type then you may fill unsatisfied in the savage levels that are released slower then other games but still provide a challenge. 

Please don't skip the story cutscenes, they are so important for immersion into the game and your character!

Balance in this game is amazing as the developers really built it to be a skill based MMO without the need to find that 1 particular gear piece from that one particular dungeon that no one plays. Gear is replaced through the story and the mechanics of the class are taught as you go. May seem slow but watch some content creators on youtube and you will see that 2.5 sec GCD means nothing when you have 2 other abilities you need to click in that time frame.",2021/06/17,0,0,0,0

"At the time of writing, you must complete a chain of at least 671 story quests to access current endgame content.  These are primarily dialogue-heavy fetch quests with a few group/solo instances thrown in.  It's worth noting that there is a paid option to skip all this.

The story quests will level you to cap, but they are generally not very interactive.  Of course all MMOs have some type of grind to reach endgame, but new players should be aware that this is what they're in for.  You're not really playing the game, so much as reading about it.  It's a decent story, by MMO standards at least, but having it foisted upon me for such a duration was not a pleasant experience.

I think this is a huge barrier to anyone starting FFXIV.  Although I enjoy the game overall, I can't in any good conscience recommend it until this ungainly bulk of outdated content is dealt with.",2021/06/16,27,5,0.630210638046264648,0
"I've played probably 90% of all MMO's in my lifetime, I still play WoW since the initial release in 2004 so I've gotten pretty used to everything in that game as well as a few others I've committed myself to. I've tried and tried so many times to get into this but I just cannot do it. A huge majority of the game is dialogue, walking back and forth and back and forth and back and forth from NPC to NPC, and just when you think you're finally about to be done walking back and forth boring the absolute hell out of yourself and get to questing... nope. Time to walk ALL the way back to the same NPC again. And chances are you're gonna have to go all the way back to where you just were after that. If you're not familiar with the map, mainly cities, or don't have someone to guide you through the cities to find those NPC's you're gonna get so frustrated walking all around, up stairs, back down, up this elevator, up that elevator and just give up and quit after an hour of walking around. And this goes on for such a long time it's ridiculous.

 It's a Final Fantasy walking / talking simulator with boring combat, unnecessary extremely annoying flashy spells. Which let me say any game with an immersive magic/wizard class is a go for me, and I've never been so bored playing a mage class in a game in my life. The skills consist of standing there pressing ""1 ..... 2..... 1..... 2.... 3.... 5....1....2.."" No fun combos, there's no entertainment in it for me, personally. 

I know most people will say ""well the best part is end-game and that's when everything starts to get good."" I can't have fun with that aspect. I like having fun through a game all the way to end-game from when you first make your character. Like in WoW you have so many good quests and at least a hundred dungeons that are all entirely different and immersive and visually pleasing and if you want you can run dungeons through the entire game, you unlock 1-5 new dungeons every other level, or there's so many other things you can do to level. Final Fantasy dungeons all look the same... It's hallway, to a big room, a couple other hallways to the next big room, a couple small bosses, then eventually the main boss.

I enjoy having to run long distances to the next area of the continent, finding quests on the way that are interesting and sometimes difficult, every section of the map looks so different and when you're done with a continent of the map, you get this feeling of ""alright, time to go on an adventure"" almost like Skyrim in a way because you know you're gonna run into so many things on the way. 

Another huge thing for me is World PvP. Final Fantasy has none of that. One of the best parts of WoW for me is having that feeling of danger not knowing what's gonna be around the next corner. You could run into a mob of enemies from the other faction and you have to GTFO and try to outrun them, try to hide, find allies to help, or have a rogue slip out of shadows and destroy you in seconds.. or you'll run into low levels and swap that roll and hunt them down. 

I know a lot of fanboys would sh*t on me for this review but then again, it is a personal review. I would rather play any other MMO than this. To have to pay monthly for this game is insane. 

I'd give it probably a 4/10 because I know a lot of  people love Final Fantasy and this could be entertaining to them but to someone who likes the single player FF games but not AS into FF, it's extremely boring.",2021/06/15,1,1,0.35550728440284729,1

"As a former WoW player (played till 9.0.5) who has painfully watched Blizzard make bad decision after bad decision, I can 100% recommend this game for players who primarily PVE. It has the standard theme park experience WoW helped bring mainstream, but has really built on a load of features. FF has player housing, a completely unique take on professions, and the ability to play all classes on a single character. If you raid in WoW, FF's raids are smaller in comparison, but sort of trim the fat (trash mobs). I can't comment on the PVP yet, but unfortunately have heard it leaves a lot to be desired (will update when I give it a solid go).",2021/06/15,1,0,0.518072307109832764,0

"I was tired of reading comments like how that game ""gets better"" and thats why i am writing this now because it obviously doesn't.

Sure something will always get better when it had a bad start but not this game.
The story may be good for FF Fans but not for everyone else. The story, no matter what expansion you are at, is full of unnecassary far streched quests and many bad unvoiced cutszenes and dialouges, that it burns you out after a few hours of playing.
 I could only keep my sanity by ingoring the MsQ (Main Story Quest) and focusing on leveling other jobs instead because I couldn't get myself traveling from one point to another just to talk to someone followed by an unvoiced cutszene and bad acting, who then was leading me to another person who also had many monologues ready for me. But where was the fighting in those quests? There was none. Just quests full of boring dialouges. 
Do not expect any action while questing. You won't find it. Just during dungeons and trials. 

I am now sitting with my 286 wasted hours in that game, waiting for the point when it actually gets better. This is by far the worst ""mmorpg"" i have ever played. I do not recommend it when you are coming from action based games. You will fall asleep too.  The Ending really  may the best part of the game becuase i am deleting it from my pc now-

"This game is my favorite MMORPG today. Im not a WoW refugee Im a Guild wars 2 refugee, I kinda just lost the love for that game after the second expansion. And I went MMO hopping looking for something else that would give me that excitement that GW2 gave me when I got it a few months after it released. And this is the MMO that did it from the amazing story to the very fun raids and trial fights i was hooked and have around 27 days in the PS4 version of the game. My roommate also plays the game and that has helped me stay so invested in the game for so long.",2021/06/15,0,0,0,0

"Final Fantasy XIV is a pleasantly shiny JRPG hiding mediocre game play, stale storytelling, and a quest roster that was dated even a decade ago. Unless you're a die hard Final Fantasy fan, you'd be better off with any of the other MMOs on the market. This game doesn't have the interactive and aggressive combat like ESO or Guild Wars 2, nor does it have the complexity of game systems like Black Desert Online. PvP is nearly non-existent, as the one player-vs-player mode plays and feels like an afterthought.

The game takes over 100 hours before anything interesting happens, with the game being bland until Shadowbringers, and because of this, along with the mediocre storytelling, I would highly recommend buying the level skip if you're really interested in playing the game. If you do that, however, be prepared to spend over $140 just to play a nearly decade old game. The story is monotonous and doesn't grip your attention, and the spaces between each expansion bring out the worst in the MMORPG genre. Without the Final Fantasy skin and notoriety, this would fall under many players' radar, and rightly so.

The price point of this game is steep, as many MMO fans are accustomed to, but seems worse considering each expansion before the most recent has no relevant content to play through, as all the content's gear is locked at the level it's done. Cosmetics are arbitrary: where some games would use aesthetic of character as a strong suit, to give better looking gear as a character levels, with the in-game cosmetic store where skins that both break the immersion of the game, and skins that make gear look far better than it is, Final Fantasy's gear means nothing at a first glance. Gear as a prestige is something many MMO's do, with stuff like the light red crystal for lightsabers in Star Wars Galaxies.

Overall, if you're a fan of the Final Fantasy series, this game has the looks that are reminiscent of the game series. If you're looking for good game play and fun combat and are into the older, static combat systems of yore, I would highly recommend purchasing the level and quest skip in the store and immediately jump into late game content, because if you don't, you'll waste over four days of time getting to something that's actually worth it.",2021/06/14,1,3,0.395209580659866333,1

"I'm writing this review as someone who would be considered, by most standards, to be a ""WoW Refugee."" If you've been finding yourself in a similar situation where you're in need of an MMO itch, but the main game you play isn't helping you, then I'd recommend giving this a shot.

Pros: - A character can be every class and master every profession. There's no need to worry about making different alts to see every corner of the game. If you'd like to stick to one person for the entire experience, you can.

- More involved storytelling than I've seen in other MMOs. Everything slowly builds throughout expansions as opposed to things being brought up and then subsequently abandoned when the next big content update rolls around.

- The art style can be hit or miss for folks, but I like it. The soundtrack didn't need to go as hard as it did, but Christ, you feel the hype.

- The community is, by and large, the least toxic community that I've seen in an MMO. You've got your gold sellers and trolls, but honestly, what large scale game doesn't have a few of those? I've had more pleasant experiences here so far than I have in other social games with people willing to teach and run through mechanics multiple times.

- UI customization. I have a friend that could spend hours tweaking what his UI looks like, and in this game, you don't even need an addon to do it. (Just as well, because the default one it gives you is, uh... a choice.)

- Glamours! You can make your character look however they want. You want to look like a typical adventurer? Sure fam. You want to walk around in a golden speedo with a chicken head? Go with God! You want to look like a cypertech abomination? We aren't going to stop you. While inventory space for your glamoured items is limited, I can't see anyone realistically running out of room for the outfits they'd constantly want to use. Compare this to WoW, where even the most basic of items for transmogging are locked behind weird caveats just ""because.""

However.

Cons: - We need to address the elephant in the room here. When everyone talks about the good story, they're talking about expansions, NOT the base game. It starts out fine enough, but it goes into a slog really fast. I'm sorry, folks, it's rough. It ain't good. There's only so much you can do for worldbuilding and fetch quest stuff before it starts feeling like padding. This is also AFTER they've done some pruning to the questlines. It took everything in my power not to buy that little boost that skips a character directly to Heavensward.

If you even have to offer something like that to people, there's a problem. There's also only so many times you can tell someone ""just to power through it"" and that ""the good stuff comes later"" when this is their first impression. If you have the patience, you should be good. If you don't...

- This is less a gameplay issue, but a technical one. Logging in through Steam, going through Mogstation, and setting everything up can be a real hassle. I've heard stories of people being charged multiple times for the same game or getting a new phone and having to re-fangle with their account to get the authenticator to work again.

- Combat for some classes can feel a bit slow in the earlier levels. This is perfectly fine for an MMO. What's *not* fine is having some of the abilities that are core to your rotation and really start making your gameplay interesting coming in at levels 50-60ish. Wanderer's Minuet, something that as a Bard player I quickly realized was essential in my arsenal aside from Mage's, I didn't learn until level 52. I can't speak the same for others. Will have to play the game more for that.


Tl;dr: Give the game an honest shot, whether you're looking for an RPG or an MMO to sate that urge. The community is good, the customization is better still, and the gameplay, while slow at the beginning, can ramp up quickly enough to keep you entertained.",2021/06/14,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0

"I’m here to share the infamous “FFXIV new player experience”. I’ve recently finished “A Realm Reborn”, so it’s still fresh in my memory, unclouded by the later expansions.

People online often talk how great FFXIV is, but in order to get to the good stuff, you have to slog through the 2.0 release. But how bad is it really?

First off, I knew what I was getting in before starting ARR. I expected it to be not that great and I was willing to persevere for the promises of Shadowbringers greatness. I was also made aware that I shouldn’t skip the main story of ARR, because it paves the ground for the future expansions.

For the first 30 or so levels I was learning the systems and mechanics, going through the introductory parts of the game. It was what you’d expected from an MMO of the early 2010s: the lore dumps, the fetch quests etc. At this point I had these initial impressions of the game:
- Pressing buttons does not feel as good as pressing buttons in other contemporary MMOs. The reason is there are start up animations for pretty much every action in the game. So even if you press an instant ability, the effect won’t register until a couple hundred milliseconds. And this delay varies per ability. So this takes getting used to. It doesn’t really affect the gameplay, because the game is designed with this delay in mind, it just feels weird and unresponsive.
- There’s a disconnect between the art style and graphical fidelity of the game. FFXIV goes for the standard modern FF pseudo realism. But the engine is not up to par. In particular, there are two big issues: aliasing and contrast/color balance. The anti-aliasing in the game is FXAA, which only makes things worse, I’d rather have aliasing problems than the muddy picture. And the color balance is just off, as if everything is passed through a gray filter. Thankfully, an industrious player might find a way to alleviate these issues on PC.
- The quests do this JRPG thing, when they explain the motivations of the characters by referring to things you have no knowledge of at this point of the game. So they feel a bit contrived. Not a bid deal, just something I noticed.

At level 30 to 40 the story sorta picks up and so does the PvE experience. That was a pleasant surprise. I thought PvE would suck until later expansions, but it gets pretty fun early in the game. Naturally, since it’s old content, PvE is a faceroll, but it’s still enjoyable and engaging. At this point in the game I have come to the following conclusions:
- The base game has no meaningful exploration. The starting zones are pretty bland and have little structure. You just go from point A to point B. It’s to be expected, since you overlevel the main story quests very early on.
- The cutscenes are very clunky, because of the stiff animations, pauses between everything and inability of the engine to combine speech and other actions. And the nodding. God, I swear, some cutscenes end with every character nodding at each other for 20 seconds. And it’s painfully slow, because they wait until each animation finishes. Also, at this point of the game you don’t really care about any of the characters, so watching them talk and nod to each other like robots all the time isn’t very interesting.
Still, despise all the issues, the bits of interesting storytelling are better for having these cutscenes.
- The voice acting is a mixed bag. And I mean really mixed. Some characters are pretty good, some are horrible.
- The UI shows its age. Later on I figured there are aspects of the game that are held back by the console versions. The devs are trying to bring uniform experience to all platforms and unfortunately it impacts the PC players. The UI is probably a victim of that as well.
- The music really kicks in during boss encounters. It’s definitely one of the high points of the game.

So I finish the base 2.0 campaign. The ending is great: the fights are cool, the music is amazing, the credits roll... And then the game grinds to a halt.
You may have heard of the infamous Seventh Astral Era quests. Basically, the are 80 main story quests between the ending of 2.0 and Heavensward, the first expansion. And they suck big time. 
And here’s why - the pacing is terrible. Funny thing is, these quests are instrumental to understand the story of the next expansion, so you can’t really skip them, if you want the whole picture. But they are intertwined with a huge amount of inane fetch quests and boring dialog. These quests will really test your patience.

Recently Square Enix has reduced the number of the Seventh Astral Era quests from 100 to 80. I’m guessing they’ve cut the quests which can be easily removed without impacting the continuity of the story. But in order to really fix the issue these quests need to be reworked completely and condensed into several hours of quality gameplay.
If you get to this point and you just can’t handle it, I’d say click through the story and watch a recap on YT. It’s not ideal, but better than quitting.

The ending is pretty good. Some plot twists, an hour of cutscenes and you’re done with ARR. I clocked around 100 hours over 4 weeks of playtime to finish “A Realm Reborn”.

Was it worth it? On its own, for me, ARR was probably not worth it. If it wasn’t for the promises of later expansions, I’d quit before finishing the Seventh Astral Era quests. To summarize the entire experience in a sentence, I’d say it’s painfully average. And it’s 100 hours.
Do keep in mind, that’s just my impression. I have seen some people say they liked ARR better than later expansions. Weirdos if you ask me, but they exist.

Does it get better? Yes, definitely. I’m 20 hours into Heavensward and pretty much all aspects of the game have improved: the exploration, the story, the music – everything.

I would recommend this game, but only with the same caveat I was given: “A Realm Reborn” is not very good but necessary part of the FFXIV experience. It’s a time investment that may pay off in the future.",2021/06/14,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0

I recently came back to try it again and found a preferred world with XP boost active.  I leveled much quicker, which also unlocked mounts faster which greatly improves mobility around the world.

"Having still not even played all the dlc, yet alone endgame i do not feel like this review is 100% valid but i feel like adding it anyways, even if it means updating later.

I have got over 160 hours in this already and i only gone as far as dlc 1. i have leveled many jobs (classes) and hopped back and fourth between them and had a blast (and some stress lol) doing it.

This game has probably the most fun classes of any mmo i played (i played a lot) however its worth saying they are only like that at high/max level! The class/job issue is that they often take long to unlock any real gameplay altering skills and passives so with some jobs such as black mage you end up casting the same 2 skills over and over up til level 50+. 
The game is still very fun and the classes are very cool and fun but they take a while to pick up in speed sometimes and that can make you get the wrong impression! 

the story is among the best i have seen in any mmo, there is some parts that drags on A LOT (such as the infamous  feast storyline) or the 100+ quests leading up to dlc 1. But as far as i know a lot of this has been culled/cut and should not feel nearly as bad anymore! (good on you devs!) The story as said is good and i dont recommend skipping it unless you are on your alt.

the downside to not skipping is hitting endgame a lot slower. I have not got endgame yet and i have 160+ hours (across multiple jobs/classes but still). if you stick to one then we are talking dozens to hundreds of hours of content, regardless of this contents quality (which is great i might add) it can feel like an eternity before you catch up to your friends. 

You have to do all the story and several short side stuff to unlock all the dungeons and raids etc as well so speed leveling is not worth it unless alternate job/class (keep in mind your 1 character can have all the classes and swap between them).

Aside from the slow speed of progression this game has a great community and is likely the best mmo on the market right now, i may have lots of hours just doing dlc 1 but i enjoyed a large amount of it, save for those cut, dragging on quests from the vanilla game.

[h1]So far i  give it 8/10, with other big mmos like WoW currently having many issues i can clearly see why people migrate here, even if you dont care for endgame or online features this game is worth it for story alone. Highly recommended![/h1]",2021/06/14,0,0,0,0

"Played WoW for 16 years or so. Switched to FF finally been playing past couple days nonstop. Dont regret a single minute of it. Cant wait to start the actual expansions though. Already recommended to all of my friends that play WoW.


!!Update!! 

100 Hours more played later. Im completely addicted. Still have yet to hit the first expansion. Just content everywhere I look. I cant remember the last time I genuinely woke up or got home from work and was excited about actually sitting down continuing an adventure on a game or just to have pure fun and enjoyment. One of best communities I have had the pleasure of starting to be a part of as well. Experience is still amazing for me so far. And I know its just going to get better and better. Cant wait!

!!Update!!
Well i am currently sitting at 340 hours or so played now. Nothing has change I am loving this. I actually just hit the first expansion Heavensward and good lord they were not kidding. Dont get me wrong i didnt mind a realm reborn... but wow just wow did they step it up in the first expansion. the cut scenes the first new Main city i am obssessed and in love with and the music that comes along with it. Most of the cast from ARR has new voice actors and damn they are good. I just scratched the surface of Heavensward and with it already shocking me how good this is getting I cant even imagine Stormblood or Shadowbringers. I can honestly say even heavensward has put WoW shadowlands to shame in all terms of story especially and cut scenes even landscape and music its just overall beautiful and being the big game of thrones fan I am the dragons and all that feel to it is just great. Its definitely not a suprise why they add heavensward into the free trial because they know after you touch that expansion you wont want to stop! :) 

Overall Take it from Me a WoW 16 year vet even with a WoW tattoo irl on my arm i lived breathed and slept WoW. I have yet to even miss a single patch or anything. Even with 9.1 that just came out yesterday while sitting here playing this now. I dont even question myself for a single second about going back anytime soon or resubbing. I am having an overall amazing experience so far and it has been keeping me completely busy and satisfied. I can honestly say this is the very first game in my life that has kept me away from World of Warcraft and for me thats a huge statement and win.

415 hours in or so. I should of easily been at Stormblood by now but i just keep getting side tracked into doing everything else in the game. Been leveling the Dark Knight up to 60 now and Finishing heavensward on him. Amazing class. Super fun story for the class as well. Machinest was my main until I recently started going Dark Knight crazy. The instant dungeon ques for tank are also a plus! And damn the Dark Knight gear just looks so good especially swinging around the big two hander feels so good as well. I should be hitting Stormblood soon though for sure as long as I dont get side tracked anymore. But honestly Im still genuinely happy and just having a blast playing this game honestly the longer it takes me to get to the other expansions the better. It is nothing like WoW where its just a strict grind fest as fast as you can to end game. Nah. Its just completely enjoy the game and have fun and do whatever you want and take your time!. Good stuff.

!!Update!!
Finally Finished Heavensward and Ill put this as simply and quick as I can. Amazing Story. Amazing Music. Just hooks you in and makes you connect with every character in the story it felt like I was just watching and getting to know every character like a full season of a show that just hooks you in. Some cutscenes were just an overall thrill and joy and by the end was hitting me in my feels haha. Simply just landed a spot in my top 10 stories of video games that I have experienced in my life.

!!!!!UPDATE AGAIN!!!

I am currently in the beginning stages of Stormblood still just chilling doing everything in the game and just having fun in general and damn the new Stormblood cities and music im in love lol. Also forgot to add in my previous posts I am starting to stream again now while I play FF and possibly league and couple other games but mainly FF if you ever wanna chat with me there just look me up!! thanks guys for all the likes awards and support by the way really appreciate it!

"Final Fantasy XIV is a massive multiplayer online role-playing game in which players can create and develop adventurers in an open fantasy world. Not only can you fight monsters and explore vast fantasy environments, but you can also gather materials and craft them into equipment, clothes, food and other items. With dozens of unique classes and jobs to choose from, you can create and develop almost any kind of character you want. Plus, with hundreds of quests, missions, tasks and activities to take on, you'll always have something to do in this game.

"I've gotten to a place where I enjoy XIV immensely -- high-quality new content is consistently released, the current story is excellent, the music is fantastic, and there's a lot to love if you're a fan of MMOs or even JRPGs generally. That comes with a big, big caveat, however: leveling your character and progressing through the story from levels 1 to 50 is an atrocious experience. The storyline is incredibly boring, the dungeons are bad, the quests are tedious -- and speaking of quests, once you hit lv. 50, you'll have to do something like over 100 of them before you can finally move onto the Heavensward expansion, which is when the game starts to get actually good. If you plan to invest time into FFXIV, I highly recommend also buying a story skip up to Heavensward and watching a recap of the A Realm Reborn storyline or something.

And the majority of people that you play with are very helpful and willing to give advice to newcomers!

It can be slow in the beginning, with filler quests and a lot of cool abilities that don't really come until later levels. Although the dev team have tried to cut out some of the more boring quests, but every expansion just gets better and better. And the later game content is super fun and can get pretty intense, with SO MUCH to do once you're done with the MSQ.

"I've been a WoW player since 2005. Unfortunately, my schedule is not conducive to scheduled activity such as raiding or serious M+ progression, so I hit a wall. My friends have been going on about the critically acclaimed MMORPG FINAL FANTASY XIV that has a free trial up to level 60 including the Heavensward expansion.

I've liked FF games in the past, specifically VII and X/X-2, so I decided to give it a shot.

First thing's first, if you are looking for a game where you can jump right into progression or competitive content like WoW/LoL/DotA/etc, FFXIV is not for you. The game *insists* that you play through the story before getting to end-game content. You can boost through it up to the beginning of the current expansion, but you must play the story then on. And, to be honest, with how strong the story is, you'd be doing yourself a disservice.

FF14 does not lack in the story department. If you have played story-driven RPGs before, such as other FF games, Xenosaga, etc, this game is definitely worth your time. The story is possibly one of the most immersive in video games as a whole. Your character is actually central to the narrative and you develop relationships with the NPCs around you over the course of the Main Scenario Quests.

The story is currently one large arc that has spanned 2.0 (A Realm Reborn), 3.0 (Heavensward), 4.0 (Stormblood), and 5.0 (Shadowbringers). This arc will be concluded in 6.0 (Endwalker). Each expansion has its own story that concludes over the course of the expansion but feeds into the overall narrative. Characters, even side characters, are rarely if ever forgotten. For example, the Thaumaturge's Guild trainers, which you stop interacting with in 2.0, show up in the grand finale of Stormblood. This makes you feel like you're a part of a living breathing world.

Gameplay wise, the jobs (classes) are incredibly tight and rewarding to play. Many MMOs have loose themes for classes that may have some synergy between certain skills, but also pollute you with a lot of cruft. Jobs in FFXIV are very tightly designed and very well balanced. This really helps you feel a sense of progression as a player as you learn more skills and master your job. The encounter design is intricate and challenging.

There are myriad additional things to do besides the MSQ and encounters. Player housing, gardening, chocobo raising, mountains of side quests, glamour, etc. Crafting is incredibly intricate and requires practice and skill to reliably produce high quality items -  a far cry from the menucrafting in many other MMORPGs.",2021/06/10,0,0,0,0

"After playing a fair amount of hours now i will have to say that this is honestly one of the best MMOs i have played. it has compelling stories amazing characters and the customization is amazing so long as you dont want to customize your class. there are a lot of outfits to choose from a lot of armors to use as a glamour  and they allow model mods. (addons like recount for damage is against the TOS so you dont have to worry too much about someone bitching about your damage output online).

*Pros*
 - you dont have to worry about being yelled at for damage
 - great story and characters
 - solid character customization
 - lots of classes and life skills to choose from
 - friendly overall community.

*cons*

 -little to no class customization
 - novice network isnt all that helpful (the novice chat is on par with barrens chat from wow..)
 - a bit on the easier side where mmos are concerned.

in a world of cookie cutter mmos and companies being unable to innovate or take risks Final fantasy XIV is a very valid choice and a very fun one at that. the game doesnt do a whole lot thats wholely unique but it does what it can in the enviroment it was made in. it would be nice if it was less tab target and more action but sadly those sorts of MMos are few and far between and normally tend to be super grindy slogfests.

 in short what final fantasy does do it does quite well.

"Overall the game is great.  The fact that you can play with very few restrictions all the way to level 60 is fantastic. It makes it so you really don't have to spend any money on the game to know if you will like it. There are quite a few things unique to this MMO compared to others, so my biggest advice is to come in with an open mind.  There are some quality Youtubers out there that give great insights on different aspects of the game, so if you want to know how specific systems or classes work definitely watch a few of those.

PROS:
-New player and veteran friendly
-World design is so unique and gorgeous from region to region
-The community is friendly and always willing to help new players
-Each class is very unique and feels that way in combat
-Leveling alt classes is fast due to the built in xp boost
-End game is much more accessible than an MMO like WoW due to the shorter required times to run Trials and raids compared to full raids in WoW
-Large XP gained from relatively easy quests makes them feel very worth it

CONS:
-Much of the story is told via text which can make those scenes feel less immersive
-The game takes away your abilities when running lower level dungeons rather than scaling down the effectiveness of the abilities and allowing you to continue using them
-Loot drops much less frequently than in most other MMO games
-Purchasing a story skip without a level boost will likely ruin your early game experience with the game",2021/06/10,3,0,0.552238762378692627,0

"I play wow and don't read quest text. This game is not for me. If you really enjoy WoW's fast combat and intense action FF14 may not be for you either.

I started playing this game because all my friends were bored of WoW, so I decided to join them. After hearing from many people say that the game started really slow I tried to slog through the boring story quests and lackluster class design to get to Heavensward where everyone say they game really picked up. Unfortunately, even after getting to Heavansward with my Paladin I still found the game boring in comparison to wow. Now don't get me wrong this game has a lot of quality of life improvements over wow, but without the ability to use add-ons, customization can only go so far. In terms of combat this is what ruined it for me. The 2.5sec gcd is just so long, and yes they give you off gcd skills to weave in between but pressing only 4 buttons to do damage 40hours into an mmo is boring. Maybe I shouldn't have played paladin but I could literally tank and entire dungeon with 1 hand (I use an mmo mouse). I almost felt bad because my friends were having so much fun and I'm sitting there bored out of my mind. If you are an addicted wow head who is accustomed to fast frantic combat, just be aware you get any near that type of combat in this game for about 100 hours. Also one of the dumbest things in this game is that in dungeons below your level remove your abilities. For instance, if you take you level 80 into a level 20 dungeon you will be scaled down to level 20, WITH ONLY YOUR LEVEL 20 ABILITIES!! It's maddening.

Pros:
-Cat girls uWu (if you're into that)
-Being able to play any class with 1 character
-Fun engaging crafting
-Accessible Raiding content
-Free Trial to level 60
-Deep Story (if you're into that in an mmo)

Cons
-Cat girls uWu (if you're not into that)
-Slow combat
-Boring character design
-Boring quests
-Dungeon and Raid scaling
-Slow class progression
-Best classes are locked behind expansion content
-Too many cut scenes
-Boring ARR story

TLDR; If you enjoy story rich rpg's and don't mind that in your mmo, and find the wow community toxic or too harsh, you'll probably enjoy this game. If you're a wow die hard and really enjoy the fast frantic combat and don't read quest don't play this.

"The best MMORPG since World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King. Best story, best characters, beautiful world, a complex and fun combat system, thrilling battles, great endgame, and a fluid job system featuring waaaaaay too many jobs for a casual like me (I've mained a single job since 2015 and only maxed three jobs).

XIV makes great use of the Final Fantasy universe, especially VI, drawing partially from what feels like every major title while maintaining its own distinct identity. Aesthetic, combat, jobs, items, villains, there's a lot of fan service but as a fan I love it.

The only thing WoW has over XIV, the only thing I feel XIV lacks, is a good PVP system. The closest equivalent is 1v1 dueling, but good luck as a beginner. Battlegrounds reduce everybody to the same baseline stats and highly limited job moveset. I don't bother with PVP due to the milquetoast, constrained experience.

XIV would be a very fun, very enjoyable game as an offline, single player adventure. It's true that the online aspect presents drawbacks like long dungeon queues for DPS classes (since there are significantly more DPS jobs than tank or heal) but the recently introduced Trust system eliminates this problem for normal dungeons (no raiding) and allows you to run dungeons single player.

I've become less active because grinding for gear gives me an existential crisis and is boring besides, but I still recommend this game to everybody.",2021/06/10,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0

"Ok. I'm 160 hours into the game. I've finished the Main Quest from the base game at around 80 hour mark. 
The remaining 80 I've spent doing the quest line in-between base and the next dlc - Heavensward. I'm not finished.
And the story before Heavensward is GARBAGE. It's full of filler fetch quests and pointless conversations that you may be scared to skip in case you miss an important detail for the bits that are actually fun (and there are a few). 
I can't progress further until I finish all of that. It's pathetic how this company allowed such a huge boring chunk of story to stop a player from having fun.

People say it's the worst part, and I hope it is, but I keep reading on the forums that this is where most people leave this game due to being burnt out. 
I won't leave, I like this game, but I am not recommending it because of this one thing. The Devs said they won't change the main questline so this stays forever, therefore, don't go easy on them. 

I love the job system, the professions, the attention to detail. 

I hate that all zones are just instances and the world feels small. 
I hate this 2.0-2.5 questline before Heavensward.


Think carefully whether you can read for 100 hours, where the text is written in old English (people say annoying stuff like: ""must needs"", ""pray"" as replacement for please, thou, and all that)
So it's not the easiest thing to read, and the story is often just filler. 


Do not buy this game for the story unless you're into this.

"I just don't think this game is for me. I lose interest in grinding through the story. I know a lot of people like it, and I'm just not one of them. I would love to see some kind of ""here's how you get to where your mission is"" mechanic. I know exploring is part of the game, but I'm finding the maps very hard to keep track of, and I just don't want to explore that much when I'm trying to unlock my classes. I'll explore when I want to explore- but please just let me keep playing through the story without getting lost. I can't even use a mount for ""Free"" yet. It's so dull running back and forth when you're too high level for where your missions are but not quite high enough to have permission to ride a chokobo. I mean sure, I can buy a mount from the store... but this game comes with a cost, and a monthly... just let me ride some kind of speed boost. ... or at least give me a bread-crumb trail between missions just so when I feel like doing missions I don't have to stop and figure out what kind of convoluted map directions I need to go in (Travelling left on the map to make it to the right side exit because the terrain curves). I dunno. 
As I said, this game might just be not for me. I've tried to play it a few times, and I keep forgetting why I don't like it... now I remember.

EDIT: Played for a bunch more time. I still stick by my not recommended vote. Found a few friends to play with and joined a FC, which added a bit more ease. Peeps helping me find places made the game worth putting more time in. Unlocking a mount helped a bit too, however the constant ""Milk run"" nature of the early game is about as entertaining as delivering packages as a job for free. 
I keep getting told the Raids are fun, and I have no reason to doubt that. 
I'm continuing to play because of the friends I found, not the game.

"This review is written someone who played this game only to level 60. ( So, before you guys pissed, take this into account. ) 

Well, I'm a big MMO guy, played almost every MMO in the market. I've been seeing this game a lot, but never thought to play it because of its name. ( Final Fantasy XIV ?! I'd probably need to play other thirteen games before I play this one, I thought. ) Anyway, it has a original an independent story than others. As soon as I found out that, I started to play.As 2021, it's the second most played MMO at the market with more than 2 millions active players, behind World of Warcraft. And I thought; "" Damn dude, you really need to give this one a shot! ""

With the new expansion - Endwalker - trailer, everyone was talking about how good it is going to be. They were talking about the PVE content and how good it is. And I created my very first character.

-Class system is only one of its kind, no doubt. You can play any class with one character and you can switch between them whenever you want! That way, playing this game feels like it always gives you a new thing to discover and this feeling is pretty nice.

-Everyone was talking about its story and how good it is, so I really paid attention to the story and the characters.. But, a few hours later - 75 hours - suddenly, I felt like the story is not that charming as it should be. First of all, there is almost no voiceovers in the first part of the game which ends when approximetaly you hit level 60. That's a shame. That's why you can't feel you're involved in the game. It's so hard to getting deep into story with limited voiceovers. Imagine that, you are in the last dungeon, you're facing with the greatest enemy that game showed you and you're expecting dramatic voices, sound effects and etc. right? But in this game, at least in its first part, its not like that. That was the first thing why I couldnt play this game anymore after some point.

- For the record, 80 is the limit.- I hit 58 level and I never DIED!  I never died in a dungeon or when doing my missions. My health bar has never down to its half. That's how this game is easy, at least it made me feel like that way. At the final dungeon of the first part of the story, when we faced with the big bad guy, it took like 45 seconds to finish him off, nothing more than that. Healers were playing with their one hand, DPS players were auto attacking and I was just standing right before the boss without doing literally anything. IT TOOK 45 SECONDS! You kidding me?
-Everyone was talking about how good the community is in this game. They say everyone is helpful, friendly and etc. I played this game 75 hours and never saw someone who is texting on the world chat. Not even a single text like; "" we are looking for players to join our new guild, everyone is welcome, we do weekly raids, endgame missions etc. "" When you get to the dungeons, almost no one is speaking, everyone is trying to get enough exp to level up as soon as possible to reach to endgame dungeons.

-And maybe you think; ""Hey! At least I can kill people in PVP and enjoy my day!"" Nah, you don't. Because there is almost nothing in this game that let you do PVP. Normally, you right click to the player that you want to interact and you see there are some options there like; trade, chat, add to friend and send duel, pvp. Right? Nope. Not in this game. You're going to the dungeons every day to get good gear.. And then what? If you can not compete with others, if you can't smash other people with your big ass sword and shut his mouth forever, what's the point of all that? İf you're looking something competitive, you're in the wrong place. 

-After some point, the combat system is getting faster but at the first part of the game, the combat system is so SLOW. I mean really, you've got only 3 or 4 skills to attack until level 50-60. When you add this to the bad storytelling, easy content and ghost community, it does not give you a good reason to play.


After I played this game for 75 hours, I watched some old World of Warcraft in-game cinematics which is made in 2000's. Believe me, characters, voice acting, story telling and feeling of exploring new things is unmatchable. As for this game, first released in 2010 or something, rather than class system and game's trailers, everything is pretty standart.

"This game presents itself for a large part of the main story as a single player RPG experience; the story is qualitywise comparable to single player Final Fantasy games which – in my opinion – is already an achievement. What really sets aside this game is the love for detail however. I was not expecting a world so full of life, colorful characters and well written plots. Especially the side adventures feature lots of comical elements.

The combat system feels refreshing. You get visual announcements to know what to do and where not stand. Learning by doing is often a welcome approach. You get extra rewards for having someone in your group who has not done the content yet.

The jobs in this game start out with a very basic concept but soon develop into a very well rounded and fun toolkit. The cooldown between the skills may make the battle system look slow at first but you keep unlocking skills that build up on those basic concepts in order to be able to create own solutions and approaches for all types of battles. The jobs differ nicely from each other in terms of core gameplay and positioning. All classes can be played on one character at the switch of a weapon and a crystal. Just to mention a few of many: There are summoners who utilize some of the well known summons of previous games to battle, healers who utilize white healing and protective spells to keep the group healthy or certain gunblade wielding tanks who give you a heavy sense of nostalgia. You will be able to unlock a mount in the form of a Chocobo early on who will also join you as a companion in battle. Different roles (damage dealer, healer or tank) can be taught to your Chocobo as skills. The chocobo is customisable in terms of color and gear (purely cosmetic).

Groups for content can be accessed by a search function or self-created. The size of the group (4 up to 24) depends heavily on the amount of time and effort you would like to invest. Queue times usually are not too long and can easily be bypassed by picking up a small adventure or two on the side. Hard content with different levels of progression is present in this game but not mandatory meaning that if you really want a challenge you will not have a trouble finding it.

There even is an amusement park, Gold Saucer, already known to some of you from playing Final Fantasy VII, which can be accessed to play small adventure games or e. g. Triple Triad (just as glorious as in Final Fantasy VIII) or to hang out with friends. You can purchase an appartment or a house which you can fill with self-created or purchased furnishings. You could even shape the layout to your liking. The location can be picked depending on which country you enjoy the most.

One of the jobs offers access to instruments (for example keyboard, guitar, flute) that can be used to perform. In some of the main cities you can sit down and watch people perform – sometimes even concerts are being held.

Flying is easily acquired in almost every zone by progressing the main story (not early on). Teleporting makes traveling fairly comfortable and easy. Leveling can be done with a variety of questing, dungeons or (non-instanced) world content. With a few weekly challenges you can get secondary jobs up to level swiftly.

The crafting system is a true gem. There is a variety of professions to pick from (e. g. goldsmith and carpenter). They are easy to pick up and items can be crafted with different qualities. A quality craft requires a certain amount of points to be acquired – this can be done by performing different kinds of rotations (you will pick up skills for this – just like in the jobs – while leveling up). There are also gathering professions that will yield you some of the required materials. Monsters can be avoided by a skill learned at early levels to gather efficiently. Later on you can even use your crafting to help rebuild a city.

The graphics are pretty and had – in comparison to a few other more current games – quite a low inpact on my system. With mid range components form years ago I could pretty easily play on high to maxed out settings. The animations are fluid and everything you press in combat feels (and looks) impactful.

Another awesome aspect of this game is the community. It is fairly easy to meet other players who also look for an enjoyable and positive experience. This game features a newbie chat where you can ask questions while playing. Mentors are also part of this chat to help. Becoming a mentor requires quite a bit of work in terms of ingame activies but from what I have seen people treat it as a privilege. Asking for help rarely goes unanswered here at pretty much all times. 

This game can be easily accessed and putting it down for something else was never an issue. Even a small amount of time can provide you with a good experience. I progressed the story in the evenings the last few weeks and was really impressed by how many weekly challenges feel optional instead of mandatory.

A few final words? First of all chapeau for releasing A Realm Reborn and Heavensward as free content (the core game and first expansion). Reading all of the above again this review feels overly positive – so far more than 300 hours in this game have not changed my mind. I wish I would have stumbled earlier upon this gem of a game. The love for detail in pretty much every direction is amazing. Thank you for all the hard work of developing this game over the years.

"  Ive played a few mmo's in the past (Wizard101, BDO, Runescape, WoW) and I have to say FFXIV is by far my favorite. It has a great story which makes leveling a pleasure instead of a chore. And unlike in WoW I can actually explore without ripping my hair out because I get swarmed by mobs if I get within 100 ft of them. Instead now most mobs will ignore me even if im right on top of them. Im a casual player and I love how relaxing it is to play this game. The music is awesome and just makes the experience that much better.
  As a casual player I dont really find dungeons/raids enjoyable at least I didnt in WoW and the few dungeons Ive done so far I FFXIV havent been any better. But one thing FFXIV does have that I love which WoW doesnt is the trials (Just fighting one boss in an arena). I absolutely love the trials in this game and when I finish the story and max out my character those will be what ill be running for fun.
 In conclusion FFXIV is an amazing game which I would recommend to any MMO fan.

"From a TANKS perspective, purely gameplay.
I don't have much visible playtime on steam, (previously a PS4 player.)
But I'm quite different in terms of how I view the game I, for one literally could not care less for the story, this opinion, will...get VERY many heated responses in game usually. I'm sure the story is alright, but that's not at all what I play it for.
Tanking is very simplistic now with the changes in SHB (Shadowbringers), the enemies have very large health pools and as a result dungeons devolve into pulling until you can't pull anymore, and using your cooldowns, while hoping the DPS kill them before you die. Like it or not, this is, in my opinion, what tanking now is. You have very little to refine once you have your rotations down, which as a tank are already very simplistic. 
However I find high end content ,very fun, the amazing music this game has really amps up some of the boss fights. But it is a bit of a slog to get to that point though, A Realm Reborn has some of the most awful dungeons in the entire game, and from what I've heard and seen, the story is somewhat slow. As a tank you really don't need to do much, just spam your AoE combos (usually 2 moves) and pop a few cooldowns every now and then.

There are actually so many other aspects of the game I love, gathering and crafting have allowed me to put way too much time into this game without becoming bored, which is strange because these are aspects people normally find boring, this game can keep you going for a long time, there is an absurd amount of time sinks in it, Relic weapons, Eureka, Bozja, Other classes, Housing, Glamour, Crafting, Gathering and a ludicrous amount of achievements.

"Has (almost) all of the things you're looking for in an MMO. If you're interested in the lore, you are unlikely to leave.

"Played this probably 5 years ago for the 9.7 hours I have and didn't really get into it.  Over the past two years or so it became massively popular and all my anime avatar/furry friends jumped over to it and it's basically impossible to go anywhere without being exposed to the game.  

I tried reinstalling and needed to recover my login information.  To recover my login information I need to install the FF14 mobile key application or whatever it's called, it's a good security measure at least.  To log into the mobile key app I need my account login information.  To get my login information I need to recover it, and the only way to do that is to use the mobile app that I need that login information to access in the first place.  The support queue took forever and after about 3 hours of getting the runaround I finally decided it wasn't going to be worth the effort anyways and went with a different MMO.  

Guild Wars 2 is pretty fun.  I've had that since it launched but only really picked it up again late last year.  There's no sub fee, it's fairly chill with a lot of exploring and little secrets to uncover.  There's good PvP and WvW is a good concept although like most MMOs it's infested with clans running ""meta"" loadouts and builds who might steamroll you if you don't know what you're doing.  I just like to fill out the map, craft stuff occasionally, and shoot the shit with my random guildmates.  I'd give that a shot if you're like me and essentially permanently locked out of FF14.",2021/06/08,0,0,0.453074425458908081,0

"I've played WoW and ESO and enjoyed those, but wanted to try other mmorpgs out for when things slow down in those since I'm not much for post-story content.

FFXIV has been pretty fun so far! The graphics, while very anime, are lovely, and my character feels a lot more expressive and alive than in the other two games.

I also love (/hate) that the pressure to try alts is non-existent. You can switch between classes and seemingly experience nearly every story on one character. I do tend to have alt-itus in WoW and ESO (one of each race and at least one of each class), so it is a little annoying that I don't quite know how to justify going through all the effort to do the same story with another character just for an extra race!

One thing I'm not nuts about is that, to progress the main story (as early as level 15ish), you MUST run through multiplayer content (dungeons/trials). Have kids at home so you try to avoid getting locked into multiplayer stuff? Too bad, you're at a screeching halt in progression until you can set aside however long it takes to beat a dungeon. You can run side quests, but if you've kept up on those, it is a pain. To be fair, so far the multiplayer content has been incredibly easy -- took about 10 minutes to queue plus 10 minutes of following experienced players, and we were through. But then, 15 minutes later, there is another dungeon required! Agh! I looked it up, and this appears to be a thing every few levels. I guess that will be my use for an alt -- when my main character gets locked in the story and has to run a dungeon, I can switch to my other character until kiddo is asleep and there won't be interruptions. 

Last thought echoed by my husband when I convinced him to try the free trial -- the map system is certainly inferior to the other two mmorpgs we've played, but you get used to it after a while. I just wish addons were a thing like they are in WoW or ESO. I also wasn't a huge fan of ESO's map but a quick addon download was plenty to fix it and now I've long forgotten what the original system was. FFXIV to my understanding from google does not allow addons at all.

Overall, cute and active game, with tons of content to play. I've had no issues with lag like I do in WoW and ESO sometimes.",2021/06/08,2,0,0,0

"+++ one of the best stories in mmorpg i ever encountered
+ amazing comunity, until you reach endgame, then you encounter weirdest form of elitism, still overyally AMAZING comunity
+ trinity system - i missed healing BADLY
+/- lot of fashion, but extreme ammounts of clipping - everything is about finding bearable combinations
- very subpar character customization, inexcusable!!! seriously
- leveling areas empty, fate system feels cheap
- unstable market
- wow style of combat - tab targetting - in 2021? - some mechanics feel extremely cheap!
--- tripple minus - epileptic hell - never had any problem in any game - this game contains the stupidiest flashing especially in dark zones (part of limited oldschool combat system and simply not enough of possibilites - let's make encounter which makes your head totally spin, and let's flash into it!!! bozja - rise of robots, and many others!) - some stuff simply unsolvable!

"Been playing this game with my father since the pandemic started.  I spent more time with him in 2020 than I did in most of the 2010s.  This is not a difficult game unless you choose to go after the option harder content, but it's a fun game and extremely accessible.  If you have friends/family who are casual gamers or not great at video games but still enjoy playing them, especially older relatives, consider trying FFXIV with them.  Especially now that you can play about 40% of the game for free before you have to give Square Enix a cent.

I've put about 1000 hours into this game and maybe 2-3 of those hours were ""wasted"" on the type of filler content you run into in a lot of MMORPGs, and what filler I did get stuck on was actually removed in a recent patch.

"Paladin's... I'm OBVIOUSLY big on the Pally... This game does them no justice. 

It's sad when every single person you talk to tells you, 1 - 50 is lame, crap, poorly done. Outdated, etc etc etc. 

Facts are, the Game Devs use this as a cash cow. The 1 - 50 Grind is trash. It's not engaging, or interesting. It's Iconic Anime B.S. that kills immersion for me. 

*Guy sits at a bar while 20+ people hold weapons at him. Continues drinking beer silently and then proceeds to kill them all.* From the players perspective, you literally just sit there beating down 1 guy while the ""Poser kid"" is killing everything. WTF? Dumb... just Dumb. I can see some level of amusement if I was maybe 12 years old. But, Really can't subscribe to this. 

Admittedly I rarely find Anime entertaining, However, I'd have been willing to look past that if the game play was enjoyable. 
With most of the Paladin's Abilities on a 2second GCD you experience a very slow and annoying grind.  I only got to level 37 before I said screw this. The Leveling didn't seem like it was endless, however it was extremely boring, I didn't care about the story, the characters, the play style. 

Now lets talk about the Company. 
The Company takes a very Strong stance on Subjectivity. If you say something they deem (at the time) as unfair to other players your account could be punished. Free Speech and the Ignore Button are two concepts the game company doesn't understand. 

From my position this game doesn't take itself seriously since vital tools to accomplishing content are bannable (Damage Meters) I understand people's dislike for being called out, but after being a raid leader in WOW / SWG / SWTOR. I can honestly say not being able to help people with rotation, and not knowing if people are pulling their weight can make it frustrating for gamers that have limited time to enjoy endgame content. Damage Meters are Extremely important from a Raid Leaders point of view since they provide information on Raid Status and Capabilities, furthermore it offers opportunities to learn about classes and characters. Instead the game forces users to keep all of that information on Discord and private group sessions. Effectively making Raid content outside of Communities very dicey. The Community just isn't Mature enough to know how to process game information and how not to use it for Epeen contesting. 

Finally Customer support is SLOW to address any issue, Quick to ban people or wrong people but not so quick to fix it. Quick to take your money, but not quick to correct your problems. This in and of itself is just wrong. 

I have found many gripes with the game. If you can tolerate what I see as shortfalls. More power to you, I hope you enjoy it. I am just not personally able to wrap my head around the immature aspects of the game and company.",2021/06/07,1,1,0.448306888341903687,0

Apparently if you start in the elven area you can learn woodworking, but if you start in Limsa, a major manufacturer of wooden ships, nope, even in whole towns dedicated to shipbuilding nobody can teach you to cut a plank, you have to wait until the main quest arbitrarily lets you go learn that. Or conversely, unless you started in Limsa, absolutely nobody can teach you to cook, again, until the main quest arbitrarily decides that yeah, you can go learn that now.

- more arbitrary gating. E.g., even in the same zone, you can leg it from Limsa to Aleport, no problem, but you can't rent a chocobo to go there (somewhat equivalent of the WOW FP) or take the ferry until you're high enough level or far enough along the story to be allowed to. Like... why? If I CAN go there, and in fact I'm sent there a few times, then why gate it so I have to go on foot every time for a while? What great gameplay does that bring?

- and the kicker: remember how I said everything is locked behind stages of the main quest? Yeah, about that... you can't progress past a stage in those unless you do specific group dungeons. I'm sorry, in WoW if I want to skip the Deadmines and go do Ashenvale quests instead, I can. Here I'm gated and can't access 90% of the game I bought unless I do a dungeon that I outlevelled by a factor of two by now. But nope, I can't go do something my level, because the devs decided I must be forced to do group stuff.

- and it doesn't seem to even help with the social aspect, if you happen to be the kind who thinks that forced group content makes a game social. Here the gating actually gets in the way of playing together even when you want to.

E.g., let's say I want to play a healer and my friend wants to play a tank. Should make it easy to find a dungeon group later with that combo, right? We start our characters together and want to always play those two together. Wait, actually we're gated so we CAN'T. My conjurer (the healer class that eventually upgrades to white mage) starts in Gridania, which has no tank class, while tank classes can start in Limsa or Ul'Dahn, which in turn have no healer class. I CAN'T go to his town to play with him until the main quest lets me, and he can't come to play with me until later.

Worse yet, when we are finally allowed to meet, we'll have done different quests, and be wildly different levels. So now what content is perfect for one, is too low or too high for the other. But wait, it gets worse. If one of us wants to, say, play rogue instead, that's a class that you can only pick at level 15, and basically starts you over at level 1 with it. Now our levels will grow even farther apart.

But it gets even worse. Now even if we do play together, we'll have to keep going to different ends of the continent for our training and class quests (which also give you your new spells.) Again, no city has the trainers for both. We'll also run into instanced solo content (aka ""duties""), so one gets to just sit and twiddle his thumbs while the other does his solo quest.

That's not a social game design. It's a schizophrenic design which sometimes incidentally forces group content RIGHT NAO, and sometimes actively prevents any meaningful long term grouping.

And just occasionally forcing a PUG isn't even making it ""social."" Social is when you go talk to other people for the sake of it. Forcing 4 random people to push the same capstan around or row the same boat isn't ""social"", it's just some group work.

- But on the whole it's not even just or mainly about the fact that it forces group content. At every point, the game basically decided that I should have no agency. I must go do X, then I can do Y, then I can do Z, etc. Not even as in because of being too low level, or them being quests in the same arc, or anything. Even most sidequests seem to only unlock when you passed the right milestone in the main quest. It doesn't even matter if I'm twice the level for quest Z already, nor that it's unrelated story-wise to quests X and Y, the game still decided I must do those exact quests in that exact order. I started feeling like I'm a scripted NPC.

Which is not what I'm looking for in a game.

But to continue with more problems:

- Square not only has a real money shop (the ""mog station""), but actually outright sells power-levelling and gold (sorry, ""gil"") on it. As in, you can not just pay to skip to level 70 with any toon, but also get half a million gil for it. Any number of times, on any number of characters you wish. As in, even repeatedly on the same character if you need more gold. Now I'd expect that to be a higher price than if someone actually went to third parties, I wouldn't know, but having the game itself just sell you gold is... distasteful, to say the least. Even most overt Pay2Win games at least try to pretend it's not just straight up selling you gold.

And it's actually worse than regular buying gold, because this one actually creates gold. See, when someone buys gold from a RMT (real money transaction) site, every 1 gold they get is 1 or more gold removed from the seller. When other P2W games let a player buy items for real money and sell them for gold to other players, again, every 1 gold they get is 1 gold or more removed from someone else who bought that item. (I say ""more"" because auction fees and whatnot may also be involved.) The gold one player bought isn't created into the game, it's just redistributed.

Square's implementation actually just creates more gold into the game. If you buy 1 million gil from them (e.g., by buying the level 70 boost for a random class twice,) that's 1 million gil just appearing into the game out of thin air. An equivalent amount isn't removed from someone farming at high end, they can still blow their full income at the high end too. It's extra money just into inflating the prices at whatever level you spend it.

- the interface is... suboptimal at times, to say the least. For example, I must bring 3 items to an NPC, but to actually complete the quest I must right click on each of them and choose to hand them over. Why? I can't do anything else with them, and I can't give anything else to the NPC. There is no choice or alternative there. So why must I individually click to hand them over? Can't the game just take them when I try to hand in the quest?

- dying doesn't move you to some nearby cemetery, it actually does the equivalent of activating your hearthstone in WOW. I.e., it moves you to wherever town you last set as your home. If you forgot to move it from another continent, sorry, that's where you go when you die.

- which also means dying can fail some quests. Well, in many it does anyway, but even in some ""kill X wolves"" quests you can't leave the zone without auto-failing the quests. And you will leave the zone if you die and had your home set in another zone.

- the game features FATE (that is, F.A.T.E.) events where basically a ton of aggressive mobs spawn in a circular area, and any players can join by just entering the circle and start killing them. Then you get some bonus XP based on what percentage did you kill. There's a lot of them. Any given zone will probably have at least half a dozen of them going in parallel at the same time.

Sounds GREAT until you realize that most of those circles are on top of places that players need to go to for other quests. Like, you could have a quest to the effect of ""kill 10 ugly rats"" (not the exact mob name) in one place, and get aggro from 3 more ""starving rats"" spawned for such a FATE event while you deal with one.

- padded beyond belief with just running from here to there and back, all over the continent",2021/06/06,3,0,0.464034587144851685,0

If you've never played an MMORPG before I'd say give it a try.  
It's free all the way up to level 60 now, which is well worth your time.

If you have played MMOs before I can say a few things that might convince you.
Gameplay, story, community and everything in the middle is great.  

Character classes (Jobs) all feel unique and while the combat starts slow it ramps up to a really nice pace by around level 30ish.  Dungeons and bosses are all pretty standard for the genre, but there are some great ones sprinkled in all throughout.

I could gush over the story for many paragraphs but I'll just say it's great.  Most of the characters you meet will be sticking around for the long haul (for better or worse, for you to decide) unlike certain other games that drop characters off a cliff after an expansion.

The side stuffs also great.  They've had two different Rouge-Like things in the game, and if you like those kinds of things you could easily waste a hundred hours in them. Also SO MANY SIDE STORIES and some of them are 10/10 amazing.  For instance the hair-dresser in this game is unlocked through one of these side-stories and he's hilarious.",2021/06/06,0,0,0,0

I always buy or start another game, but then I just get the feeling that I want to go back and play FFXIV. Truly a beautiful game filled with so much content, and the story is amazing.

"This game follows the trend of other MMOs in that there are three roles: tank, healer, DPS. You  have an essentially open world wherein you can choose to do battle, gather things, meet other people for optional activities, take screenshots of the landscape and/or yourself, and so on. The breadcrumb series of major and minor quests will lead you around Eorzea, ever guiding you into higher level areas, introducing you to new NPCs, new encounters, and new gear. There's a lot of lore to unpack for each region if you're into that, there are minions, mounts, aesthetic gear, book logs, in-game cards, and other optional stuff to collect if you like. There's even a cash shop for even more aesthetic gear, and none of it will assist in your gameplay other than give you a particular look. You never need a cash shop purchase to be an effective player here.

Where this game differs slightly is in how it's all implemented. You are not locked into a single role or class, and this appeals to me greatly because I enjoy expanding my viewpoint of this game through different roles as my whim dictates. Wield a different weapon and bam, you are that class. Most classes start from level 1, and the benefit of that is that you can learn to play that class from the ground up. Each class has a basic rotation, with some extra stuff thrown in for extra/burst damage. Some of it is 1v1, some is AOE-centric. Most classes get their better attacks and more full rotation after lvl 50.

This is my seventh year of game play, and I still don't have all the mounts, all the minions, all the aesthetic gear, all the in-game cards, and so on. I have played a number of classes but I still have half of them to level to the maximum. I am a casual player and I still find reasons to log in every day--quests, gear, friends to party up with, personal goals, an ever-changing list of random things to do due to daily/weekly quests. Leveling is satisfyingly fast, gear is easy to acquire, and most dungeons and creature mechanics are pretty easy to figure out--they always show you what's going to happen and get you a taste of damage before they go ham. I have arthritic hands and I will never feature in the top tier of DPS because of that but I can still hold my own in combat and contribute meaningfully to a successful run. 

tl;dr
Cons: 
--GCD feels slow
--low-level combat is unsatisfying
--main scenario quests and instances are required to unlock higher level areas
--monthly subscription is required beyond the first expansion
--there is a small learning curve
Pros:
--optional cash shop is truly optional
--combat level 50+ starts getting good
--each area has its own lore, aesthetic
--you don't need to have played any other Final Fantasy game to thoroughly understand and enjoy your time
all players on PlayStation, PC, and Mac can coexist and interact with each other
--the free trial (limited in function, not in time) is still robust enough for you to truly see how this game is presented, allows you to interact with other players, and enjoy your time
--despite it being a Japanese-made game, there are robust English (also German and French!) voice-acting, text, and interface elements, allowing you to view and interact with this game in the way you choose in settings.

"Where do I start? Oh yes, FFXIV Online is probably the greatest game so far that I've played in my first ever Final Fantasy with almost 10 hours into the game, and enjoying it so far. The game is great so far as in terms of gameplay, wonderful graphics, great side missions and story missions to do so far. I've examined the tons of gameplay via YouTube videos before purchasing the starter edition, which is worth roughly $20 without the DLC purchased. I also love how new players get 30 days of subscription time, Realm Reborn and expansion pack Heavensward. But, I can say it's worth $20 if you're a newbie to MMORPG games or RPGs in general.

Pros:
- Graphics are beautiful
- Gameplay is excellent
- Audio (music, etc.) is a masterpiece
- Great for low-end PCs (the game supports lower graphic settings)
- Difficulty is EASY, but gets medium

Neutrals:
- Game doesn't reinvent the MMO wheel. It is a pretty standard ""theme park"" MMO. That being said, it is extremely polished and everything in the game is executed very well.
- Subscriptions are a bit pricey

Cons:
- Some issues with combat on my end
- Audio is kind of loud, even at 18%
- Some lag in certain areas

"One of the best mmos available at the moment. I was, and still am, a longtime fan of World of Warcraft and this game does most things way better. The soundtrack is stunning, the characters and fashion are beautiful, and the world is diverse and full of life. My only complaint so far has been that none of the npc speak to you with their voices, it's entirely text-based conversation; not even a ""Hello!"" voiced when you click on them. There are no voices. This would be almost a deal breaker if I didn't have people to play with, as the not being able to hear idle chatter in the background or be greeted by npcs is extremely lonely, which is not how I want to feel while playing an mmo. Still, even with that compliant, the game is quite remarkable and I see myself enjoying many hours in it's well crafted world. It's superior to WoW in almost every way except for pvp and npc voicing. I recommend playing with a friend in vc so you aren't lonely, but that's just me.",2021/06/03,2,0,0.53316950798034668,0

, graphics, gameplay it’s all great! Only thing that’s a negative would be the in game ping (it’s built into the game nothing to do with personal internet) but once you get used to it, it ends up being a non issue and sometimes helpful.",2021/06/03,26,5,0.675277352333068848,0
"If you like running from place to place carrying messages and listening to npcs wax poetic about how awesome they are, or how bad a fight was somewhere, this game is for you. You might even get to fetch one of these god's a glass of orange juice if they let you - it'll be six maps over though, so get ready. Nothing does it better for monologues, soliloquies, and running in between . It's like being in a graphic novel that makes you run across three maps to turn a page. 10/10

However, if you are looking for action (I am a level 21 glad/11 conjurer and about two hours total isn't from listening to npcs talk or ask for a bobble ten map areas over) and to feel involved in a story, this ""game"" really isn't for you to ""play."" I fell asleep three times during all the running, riding, and flying to turn in the next quest to click through ten minutes of dialogue. 

Honestly, I don't know the point of ""playing"" this thing. I'd move past this if I were considering a game that I  wanted to play or feel like I wasn't on a dialogue railroad. If you are wanting a story, just watch an anime film, it'll cut out all half an hour of running and twisting maze places in between scenes and might provide some enjoyment.",2021/06/03,0,0,0.466830462217330933,0

If i have to name one bummer, it got to be the pace at the beginning, the combat is slow and fetch quests are tedious. Imagine doing 2.0 quests without flying, ahahaha.....ha, ha, yeah.

"Best MMO I have ever played and I had a huge MMO phase. The genre got boring for me and I quit for other types of game for a long time. My friend told me about it and it was weird for me, because I knew this game existed for a long time. I just never gave it a chance.

The story is excellent so far, interesting and lovable characters (or annoying/hatable/intimidating when the game requires). I have a level 53 Bard and the boss fights are very fun. The soundtrack is top notch, and really adds to the game a new level of emotion in a great way.

I also really appreciate how they do not push any extra purchases in your face... I didn't even know there was fun extras that I could buy until I happened to find it after 54 hours into the game. I love a company that doesn't make you feel bad about not buying the ""deluxe"" or even micro transactions. Imagine a company that actually lets you feel good about your base level purchase... lol. Well done and very classy.

This game renewed my faith in MMOs and I am looking forward to many more adventure packed hours as I finish the main story and work my way into the expansions! Give this game a try, I am very glad I did! :)",2021/06/03,1,0,0.500665783882141113,0

"90 hours in; I will give you as brief as possible set of takeaways:

1: The pace of this game is abysmally slow, both in how the classes flesh out and the story being told. The classes don't flesh out into meaningful, diverse arrangements until the 50's; until then it's just 1 2 3 combos forever by pretty much every class. My friends keep promising that the story picks up at some point, and it feels like that point is never actually coming.
2: The English voice acting is stunted, rigid/robotic, and immersion breaking. Absolutely horrendous. Like if they cracked jokes in this game it would be Resident Evil 1 levels of terrible.
3: the gear is pretty cool looking so far (later level gear).
4: I wish more classes were open sooner; a good 80 hours of my game play was spent leveling the Dragoon class to 50, which for me was as boring as can be (slowest GCD in the game = slow pace fighting and dying brain cells). Because I hadn't completed ARR's main quest line by this point, I only got Red Mage (my main class for now) and Samurai.
5: I want to like this game, but I'm struggling to. 
6: RP related - for me, I like having a bruiser of a character (Hammers, Mauls, etc.) for dps. There is no equivalent for that in this game. The Warrior is a tank class, so the closest i could get would be this, even though I have little interest in tanking. If RP is important to you, scout out the classes to see which makes the most sense for your character.

I'd say give it a try for yourself if none of this matters to you, but I wouldn't personally put myself through this again. I'm barely hanging on to play it at all at this point.

"I used to be a WoW addict for 6+ years until the game just wasn't fun to me anymore for a lot of reasons. I heard FFXIV was a rival game, so I gave it a try and I've had zero regrets. There's so many things FF has to offer that WoW doesn't. Immersion, class identity, a great community, class balance, cool outfits and so many other ways they've thought of to keep the gamer happy, not just fill their pockets with money. And after seeing a bit of this year's digital fan festival, you could totally tell that the devs were one big family that pour their hearts and souls into this game and also have fun with it. They even have their own band and did some of the dances you can collect in the game.

I think my most favorite things about this game are being able to have every class and job on one character, the game/dungeon/raid design (I have over 3k screen shots and I'm only just starting the third expansion >_>) and the music. The music is amazing. I also really love how you can take your time with the game and not really miss out on anything.",2021/06/02,1,0,0.500665783882141113,0

The main story is very single player friendly and for when you do need/want a party it has a handy system to find members for you those of us too shy to stand in town and scream LFG! And to ease us out of our shells, this game has one of the most supportive and inclusive communities of almost any video game I have ever seen. There will always be toxic players in any community but after 1000 hrs of gameplay, I have had maybe four encounters with them and that's a pretty good ratio. If you love games with strong story and characters, this will also please in that department. This game WILL make you care. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants the online connection of an MMO but the story and care of a single player open world game.

You are the main character. Other MMOs can make you feel like an NPC, while the NPCs arew the big names in the world who save the day. You're a side character in their stories. Here? You are the hero, you are the main man(or girl). Highly recommended to fans of the FF series as a whole, or newcomers to the series. If you like FF or MMOs, you'll love this.

"I have currently played until Heavensward, and since I was so far behind in terms of story and content, that it basically played like a single-player RPG. Even then I enjoyed the game, mainly because the story and characters are very well written, mainly Heavensward. 1st part (ARR) can be a little grindy and confusing, but heavensward was one of the best RPG I have played in terms of story.

The only MMO part that I did were dungeons and some raids, which people just run through because everyone is overpowered, so it doesn't have the endgame feel which people generally play MMOs for, I probably need to get to shadowbringers if I actually want that. I liked the bosses design wise, but since everything dropped so quickly, you don't even get see all the mechanics and challenges.

Gameplay wise, I like the combat, there are plenty of classes to choose from, and you can level multiple on the same character which is very comfortable. There is not any customisation inside those classes though, you basically wear the best gear and call it a day, different build for each class would be nice, but it was not an issue for me,

I'm looking forward to playing the next expansions, from the story perspective alone, maybe this time I will actually reach the endgame to experience the MMO part of it.",2021/06/02,0,0,0,0

This game is amazing, the way the characters build up their skills, the story, the huge amount of dungeons, the variety, and depth of all the jobs, not to mention it looks beautiful!

"I will update this review as time continues and I experience more and more of the content.

I have already spent over 150+ hours on a single character, but I have not even completed the A Realm Reborn content, though I am close. I imagine others could get farther than me in less time, but I have taken my time in order to see as much as I can in whatever order the content was released. So far, I have completed the original Main Scenario Questline and the first 4 patch Story content, including both the Coil of Bahamut and Crystal Tower raid story lines. I started my journey by levelling my Warrior to level 50 and have since also levelled a Dragoon for their Job Quest line to prepare for Heavensward.

I explain all of this because the majority of the praise of this game and the reasons fans tend to give for others to play often revolve exclusively around the Expansion content. As of yet, I have no experience to base any of that on and yet I still highly recommend this game. With a few caveats.

**STORY**

As countless others have already explained, the beginning of your journey in this game is slow and often monotonous. The main scenario quests up until around level 35 are packed with frustrating filler content and fetch quests or even worse, quests which require you to run around multiple zones in order to talk to someone, only for them to direct you to someone else. Even then, the story content doesn't get truly interesting until after the credits roll on the A Realm Reborn, minus a few stand out moments.

What does shine during these moments is some of the dialogue writing as well as the worldbuilding. Even with as artificial as some of the world design can feel compared to other modern MMO's, the zone layout, the political entities, the characters roles in their different societies and the way the talk and behave do a better job at making the world feel like a real, lived in place than any other MMO I've played, even with as silly or over the top the setting can sometimes be.

Once you reach the Patch content, particularly 2.2 onwards, the story focused content really takes off and gets vastly more interesting, which wouldn't have been possible without what the base game took the time to establish, though of course they could have done so better had they had the time during development, which I imagine is the main reason it had a lot lacking early on.

As I progress in the game, this section will likely be what I update the most as things are likely to improve greatly through each expansion if what I've seen online proves true.

**GAMEPLAY**

This is mostly standard MMO fair. You've got solo content through various quests and activities and you have instanced content of various types and levels of challenge that requires a group of anywhere between 4 to 24 players. The combat is standard tab-targeting style with quickbars to organize your abilities which have cooldowns, some sharing a rather long 2.5 second global cooldown, which further makes the game feel slow early on when you have less abilities available to your job.

At first glance, you might assume that there's little different from this game and other Everquest/WoW style MMO's. But you'd be wrong.

Yes, there is a lot similar. So much so, that a lot of people playing this game were attracted to it because of those similarities. And as I'm still a relative newbie to the game, I can't comment on everything that is similar or different.

What stands out to me however is the sheer variety of the content available in this game and how that content is accessed through your journey. The first and primary thing you will be spending the majority of your time doing is the previously mentioned Main Scenario Quests. These are exactly what they sound like, story focused solo questlines that evolve the story, characters and progress through new locations. You have to do this questline in order to unlock virtually all of the content in the game, including group instance content.

Besides the MSQ, there are the instances themselves which are grouped into 4-man Dungeons, 4-8 man Trials, 8-Man Raids and 24-Man Alliance Raids which consist of 3 8 person groups working together in one instance. The normal versions of this content tends to be fairly easy, though occasionally there are certain mechanics found in specific instances that can catch a group off-guard if they're unfamiliar or unprepared. Each category of instance also offers higher difficulty versions of them with Savage difficulty 8-Man Raids being considered the main end game challenging content in the game. However, my personal favorite instance type has to be Trials. Rather than an entire dungeon that you have to fight a series of mobs or challenges in order to progress, it's simply a single mega-boss that you fight and then you're done. Not only is this usually much quicker, but the simplicity has allowed the developers to get rather creative with their boss design and they prove to be a fun challenge with a large variety of special mechanics of their own.

Finally, outside of this content, which serves as the main course of the game's buffet, you have a variety of additional activities to do. There are side quests, FATES, content logs, Deep Dungeons, Gambling mini-games, Beast Tribe quests, Grand Company quests and the list goes on. It'd take too long to explain everything this game has to offer in this regard, but the variety has kept my attention far better than other MMO's which tend to either focus on a small selection of content types, or pad their content with too many boring but necessary things that feel required to stay relevant.

On top of all of this, one of the biggest things that differs in this game is that every single job in the game can be played on one single character as opposed to requiring you to level alts that end up having to go through the same content over again each time, making the process of playing as different roles and playstyles much easier and more pleasant and furthering that feeling of variety.

**PRESENTATION**

The music is fantastic. This isn't an unpopular opinion, but the various tracks in this game deserves all of the hype it gets. It makes the experience what it is, and should be experienced by everyone who plays. Don't turn it off, at least not at first.

The visuals are not going to be everyone's preferred style. I myself have taken a bit to adjust to some of it. I'm not typically a huge fan of some of the types of media this game shares it's aesthetics with like Anime or Manga. There's cat girls and gunblades and everyone has silly haircuts. However, it hasn't detracted anything from the experience for me. If anything, it's actually proved to be rather refreshing compared to the traditional Westren RPG's and adventure games I'm used to, which is one of the reasons I was initially interested in trying this game. Additionally, some of the environments are gorgeous, particularly some of the dungeons and raids.

**CONCLUSION**

This game is wonderful. I'm aware that 150 hours is still very little when compared to what's necessary to experience the full game, and I'm still in the honeymoon phase, but this is already more time than I've spent on any other MMO and I don't feel like I want to slow down any time soon.",2021/05/31,0,0,0,0

I have been playing on and off since beta, and I always have a great time in every expansion. I love that your character can have every job, instead of having a bunch of alt characters. I also really like the fact that you must complete the story quests, because it sets a great standard, versus allowing people to skip to the end, making them inpatient and lazy. When events come to the game, some currencies will be awarded for the long, main story dungeons, so people queue up for them and help out players who are leveling.

But, they are completely optional and usually some kind of special items like unique mounts or the outfits of NPCs in the world, and there is plenty of mounts and armors and other things to farm without spending extra. One thing that is really cool is weapons and armor from harder content is NOT added to the cash shop, so people can't buy their way to what you achieved with hard work.

"They expect you to register through 2 websites before you play. If you had a square enix account from a long time ago, they will only let you set your password if you can remember both the security question you used AND the answer. So I couldn't log in and use my account,

So I Create a new account and tried that way. The secondary website ""MogStation"" can't find the new account I just created and confirmed though my email.

The primary website has an area where you can register game codes, but are in a completely different format than what steam provides. I have typed it in several different ways. Without the hyphens, spaces, etc. 

Something that so popular and only cost 20 dollars shouldn't take complex algorithems and several hoops to jump through before you can simply launch the game. I can't register or play it at all. No matter what I do.

*Edit: I was finally able to get it working, and it wasn't any error on my part. After finally getting into mogsation and registering the code, I STILL got the error message telling me to register.

So then I realized, the launcher has invisible buttons you cannot read because it's completley black. But there's a *Next* button on the launcher error page. AND EVEN THEN, they tried telling me I didn't have any product registered with tat account. I tried a second time a few minutes later and it worked.

"Look, you can just see how much I've played this game to know that I like it. It's a good game with a great free trial you can play if you want to get a feel for it. You've probably heard it all before from word of mouth so I'm not going to try and sell it for you here just know that it's really good.

What I *am* going to try to do is let you know about a few things before you buy that I don't see a lot of people telling new players.

First, and maybe the most important: *If you buy the game on steam you can only buy the steam version of the expansion*
- What does this mean?
If you buy FFXIV from Square Enix directly you can only buy future expansions from them and only them. This means that if steam is having a sale on the expansion you cannot participate in it. The same goes with Steam. If you buy the game on Steam you can only buy future expansions from steam and not Square. This can be frustrating as I've seen people buy their game from the wrong place and waste money. Double check where you bought your game first by going to your account on Mogstation and seeing which version of the game you own.

Second, there are two types of subscriptions: Entry and Standard subscriptions are different
- What does this mean?
There are two types of subscriptions. 
The first is the Entry subscription which is 12.99 USD and is 30 days long. This gets you one character per sever with a total of 8 characters over all. I'd say go with this for your first month subscribing and if you still like the game you can move up to a standard subscription.
The second is the Standard Subscription which, starting, is 14.99 USD. This one has 8 charcters per sever with a total of 40 overall. With a standard subscription you also have the option to purchase multiple months at a time. This can save you money in the long run especially if you are really into the game. 
There are also little additions you can get like an extra retainer for a little fee each month but this is completely optional as it's just a form of inventory management. 

Third, for those who are used to WoW: You can play every class, and every job, on one character
- What does this mean?
Every character you create can swap classes by changing weapons. Meaning, you can play anything you want when you want to. If a new class comes out you only have to be at the level the class requires, you don't have to create a whole new character for it. This was a big draw for me as swapping characters all the time was a real pain. Yes there's still some grinding involved as you'll have to level up that class as well now, but you don't have to always start from square one. If anyone who used to play wow is reading this, name changes and race changes are also way cheaper from what I remember them being in WoW. A name change is 10 USD on here and a Fantasia, which is a way to completely makeover your character changing, race, gender, and nearly everything else save the name, is also 10 USD but can also be bought in packs of 3 or 5 that can save you some money.

Overall it's a good game but these a just a few things, off the top of my head, that can help people new to the game. If you're reading this I hope you have fun at least trying it out.",2021/05/29,551,3,0.978462517261505127,0

"This is one of the best games on the market now. Shadowbringers specifically, is the best Final Fantasy story ever, and even one of the best in all of video games. The gameplay, while different depending on what you've played previously (I'm primarily a FPS player), is super satisfying and very engaging. If you like great stories, incredible music, or fantastic characters, you should play this. No questions asked.

I would recommend buying this off of Square's own website and setting your account up there, as there is less hoops and tape to go through down the line if something does happen like it did for me.

The combat-gameplay is something I didn't think I would like that much. As someone who has mostly played action and FPS games, when I experienced the early level combat, I was severely unimpressed. It was hard to control with the keyboard, and it was just super linear and boring. Now, I think that combat is one of the best types of combat I've played. This is tied to two things: the class abilities, and the controls. The class/jobs get more complex the higher level you are. At around level 40, the jobs start being more involved, with skill combos, rotations, and a bunch more that I don't have the word count to describe. All jobs are both fun and good, so no worries about picking a ""bad"" job. For controls, I highly recommend getting the 12 num-pad mice if you want to use mouse and keyboard. Don't know the controller experience. It is the only reason I stuck with the game as I was very frustrated with the controls very early on. I can't understate how much of a game changer this was for me. 

There are two roadblocks for people that are unfamiliar with MMO's compared to other games: time needed to play, and paying for it. 

Regarding time, the hours I have on Steam are just me playing Realm Reborn (ARR), Heavensward (HW), and Stormblood (StB). On my Square Enix account, I have 670 hours, which starts at the end of Stormblood as I skipped the expansions the second time around. This takes a long time to play, and about half of the 276 hours are pretty bad. ARR specifically is almost entirely forgettable, and has almost nothing in it that I would recommend you go play. However, playing through it is something I would say you do, as it sets up other story lines in future content, and those will feel less impactful if you do skip ARR. Past ARR, the game improves dramatically. The missions are all better, combat is more interesting, the story involves more engaging characters, it's all just better. Won't saying anything more, but if the first 100 hours were a slog, the next 170 will fly by.

On to pricing, which will seem daunting at first. First off, you can play ARR and HW completely free of charge. This is great, as HW is amazing on it's own and shows how great the story can be. In terms of everything else, you have to pay for the StB and Shadowbringers (ShB) expansions along with the monthly subscription. Again, I would purchase and manage everything through Square's own page and not Steam. I will say that this is well worth the price of admission. You can turn off your payments for the month if you just want a break, and you'll lose no progress or anything if you do. You don't pay for any playable content, outside of the expansion, any time. There are both cosmetic purchases, which are up to you on how you feel, but there are story skips and job level boosts. I would highly recommend against both of these. The story is by far the best part of the game, and isn't worth skipping. (Maybe ARR if you are on the verge of quitting because of it) As for the jobs, they get complex pretty fast, and if you jump in with no clue what you're doing, it'll be a bad time. I would just steer clear as it has more problems then benefits.

If you read all this, I hope you consider giving this game a play. The trailer for Shadowbringers, which is two years old, gives me goosebumps whenever I watch it because of how much impact it made on me. Even some of the songs will make me tear up because of the moments they represent. Not many games have that level of impact.",2021/05/29,3,0,0.561752974987030029,0

"I was never big on MMO's when growing up, I have tried many but they never seem to catch my eye or entertain me cause of prices or mechanics and I love RPG games but MMO wise always is a turn down, well after so much time pondering this FF and so many friends begging me to try it I bought it just before the last patch of Shadowbringers came out and.......WOW! This game has caught me by surprise! The games mechanics feel great, the variety of classes and choosing how you want to play around in the world is fantastic, playing alone feels great when no one is on and when i need to do party searches yes they may be slow but after I find one most of the time I am with great people who do their best to help if I'm new to it. I can go on and on but to keep it simple this game is worth the money and subscription, story is nothing but fun and intriguing, their are some cons but nothing major I can really detail since they are adjusting it as new updates come and other than that, I beat the whole story up to the latest patch and already bought the pre order for Endwalker if that doesn't show how much I love this I don't know what else to say, get the free trial and try it for yourself I think for anyone casual like me or hardcore this is a game you will enjoy a lot. for a point score to be really honest since I don't do MMO's a lot this game without a doubt is a 10/10 in my book for keeping me enjoying it whenever I have the time.",2021/05/29,2,0,0.522348344326019287,0

"I love that literal braindead people can't manage the play the game and whine about it .d

Although i love the game so far, it has more cons than pros for me. I played WoW for many years. And had no fun after Legion. RIP last good (and one of the best) expansion of WoW.

+Very friendly community (so far, at least)
+Good designed/balanced classes which are better than the WoW classes. (You can check logs for that :D)
+Story?
+There is a content for everyone. E v e r y o n e. But not for bigots.
+Dragons in the game are better than every other Dragons in any other game.
+You can play any and every class you want in one character. But you need to level it up ofc.

-ARR quests, general early quest design. Terrible.
-Tataru
-Again, early design of classes. First 50 levels are nightmare.
-This is the biggest nay for me. You can't play&progress with your friend while questing together. Unlike WoW. There is certain parts that you need to ''get in'' alone and you need to disband your party. And usually game acts like your friend is not there. For example, game wants you to kill 4 bears, you need to kill 4 bears. When your friend kills a bear, it doesn't count on your quest progress. This is just an example, there are so many variatons of this. And i think this kills the experience playing with a friend.
-Loading screens while changing zones. This is an another boner killer. Kills the open world experience.
-Item descriptions are not noob friendly. You need to research for almost everything :D
-Dungeon&Raid design is good, but you need to ''experience'' or again, do a research for almost every serious fight. Because game tells you nothing about it (not talking about common sense). There is no in-game guide, no warnings. It can be annoying for WoW players. And some players can get upset when you whine about this :D 
-Though it is a game with rich customize options, collectibles(mount, transmog, hairstyles :D, etc.) there is no in-game journal for you to look at your progress or check the thing that you haven't collected yet. You need to look it up from 3rd party internet sources/discord channels or webpages.
-NPC's has no soul or character so far. They don't have a voice most of the time. 

Those are the pros and cons for me so far. Yet, i am a new player and i may be wrong about some of the things i mentioned. Looking forward to waste my life on this game.",2021/05/28,0,1,0,0

"Final Fantasy XIV is one of the best MMO's I've played in a long time. With over 500 hours of base game story and missions. FFXIV takes the cake when it comes to other MMO's and their development. You can get the ""Free Trial"" witch gives you the entire base game to experience. Once you get to about level 50 that's when the main story ends and transitions into it's first DLC.

The Free Trial essentially gives you an absurd amount of time to decide if you want to play the DLC adn to be honest, if you're level 50+, you've probably already payed for the DLC and game time. The DEV's really care about the game and it's community and you can see that with all the effort they put into map design and story creation.

I can assure you that each level in Final Fantasy XIV will feel unique and rewarding in its own way. Coming from WOW, the experience for me has been breathtaking. Fleshed out and relatable characters, high stakes, simple yet enjoyable systems, endless evergreen content. This game marks all of my boxes.

I will say... if you are looking for an MMO experience, FFXIV is a Final Fantasy game FIRST. Story is at the forefront and if you are to get any enjoyment/fulfillment out of this experience, you HAVE to pay attention to what's going on in the story.",2021/05/28,0,0,0,0

"A WARNING FOR WOW PLAYERS.

This is a game that focus' way more on story than WoW, but more importantly, it tries to mimic the WoW combat, while failing. In FF XIV, instead of a 1/1.5s Global cooldown (GCD), it's a massive 2.5s GCD. This feels terribly sluggish, and even more so when the realization that it's not going to get better as you level up sinks in.

For non WoW players, or new to MMOs, this is probably the best subscription based MMO you can start in. Great story, very slow combat and quite interesting crafting with friendly and non-hardcore players.

If you're someone who played WoW somewhat seriously and is used to that combat, I can't recommend FF XIV for you, because the combat is atrociously slow. For Lancers/Dragoons (the best* melee DPS class) the rotation consists of simply pressing two buttons up to level 26, then it's 3 buttons until you're level 50. You might say that WoW is only slightly better in that regard, but the fact is, that in WoW you still need to think, because of the fast GCD. So you'll need to make more decisions and react to the procs you're casts generates and how to spend you're combo points. FF XIV, as far as I've seen for melee classes, you'll only be following a string of casts, each with a terribly long GCD. You don't need to think, you simply follow the slow combos, which are always the same no matter the situation.

Something going for FFXIV is definitely the players who are nearly all very friendly and the systems attached to leveling. There's quite a few ways to level up and a ton of side quests systems. Although the abilities are terribly slow, you get to watch a cool animation and special effects.

My rating for this game falls in the mixed category, but since I can't really recommend it, it needs to be a negative review. 
5/10 maybe 5.5/10.

"246 hours and im finally hitting 3.1 content (heavensward patches). People say the arr story is trash and forgettable. It is! But its so charming and cute, and sets up the universe i dont care. I only care about discovering this universe as a non final fantasy player. 

Let me explain it to those who dont know: Its a mish mash between high fantasy, steampunk, and space marines or something. Theres this big bad empire encroaching on our happy hippy magical fantasy universe. We fight them and win. Thats the ARR story. In heavensward, now that we've defeated the space marine empire, we fight dragons. But the dragons are kinda smarter than us. So we all get along in the end. Its also very dumb. But its still cool for some reason. 

Heres the big glaring issues: 

The MSQ FORCES you to play with other people. You HAVE to finish the MSQ to progress. If you dont do the MSQ, you are stuck in ARR forever (unless you pay for the skip - dont pay for the skip, just getting your head around this is a JOURNEY in itself). BUT... completing the MSQ makes you way better at your job/class anyway. I mained a healer. I log off for at least 2 days any time i have to face a new dungeon in the MSQ because im terrified. But... when i find the resolve and just do it, its never that bad. Play a tank if you want quick queues with limited responsibility. Play a healer if you want quick queues and a lot of responsibility. Play a deeps if you love sequences/memorising patterns and zero responsibility (except ground mechanics with massive telegraphs).  

Dont, please dont, just play through the msq on your first play through. Its not fun. Its a lot of cutscenes, teleporting and delivery quests (interspersed with the very occasional action). Just enjoy the world, the other jobs, all the systems (imagine not knowing what the hunting log or guild heists are before level 40? - you really will... i still havent found time to go play in the golden saucer). This isnt an 'end game is the real game' game. Its about the universe. You're really messing up your game if you're only about the end game...

UNLESS... my best mate is a min-maxing power gamer. He just wants the best and coolest gear. I would NEVER suggest he plays through the main game from start to finish. If i wanted to get him into the game, id PAY for his boost and even grind his character through shb so he can play savage/ultimates. If thats what you want to do. Do that. ARR would destroy your interest. You'd hate it. Dont do it. Just buy a boost, practice your rotation for a few hours on a target dummy, watch some guides, then go ham. You're gonna have a lot of fun. Fights SEEM (what do i know?) really complex. Just turn down the effects of other players so you dont have to don your sunglasses to play the game. 

Point is. Its awesome. As an explorer, i love just finding out new stuff about the universe without feeling pressured to hit end game. But if end game is all you want... you seem to be taken care of. If you know what kind of player you are, you'll find your spot and you'll get your money's worth.

"[h1]Where do I start?[/h1]

I created my character in October 2020; looking for a game of my own, that I could play during my off time. My brother played a lot of this game back in 2015, so I thought 'why not? There's a free trial anyway.'

Play it through Steam, or through the FFXIV client, both work just fine, there's no difference. I just find it easier to regroup all of my games on Steam; it handles the monthly billing like a charm.

[h1][u]TL;DR[/u][/h1]

- Play your own way. Make your own experience in the world of FFXIV.
- Masterful soundtrack. Beautifully aged scenery and graphics.
- Intricate combat system, easy to learn, hard to master. Many classes each offering a fresh, different playstyle.
- Slow to start but gripping story. Heaps and heaps of content unlocked through the main story, and even some really obscure content for those who like to dig further.
- Character creation and customisation worthy of dress-up games. Anything you want, or can think of, exists and can be worn.
- No huge amount of grinding for those sticking to casual/current content.

[h1][u]Now for the review![/u][/h1]

[h1]Quick maths about the subscription[/h1]
- At the time of this review, I have 836 hours of gameplay (maybe with 5% being AFK)
- A standard month of sub is worth €13, and I've been playing for 7 months : 7*13 = €91.
- [u] In short, if you apply the €1 an hour of gameplay, it's very easy to make the investment worth it. [/u]

[h1]Character creation has everything to satisfy any itches you may have[/h1] 

You can go for a standard, vanilla human, a cat girl or bunny girl. You can even be a sturdy big-arm lady or a tiny cute Super-Deformed dwarf (looking at you Lalafellins!)

The choice of colours, haircut, face shape, eye colour and much more, leaves much to the player's creativity. [u]It has just about enough for you to create a character that feels your own; your own unique Final Fantasy protagonist.[/u]

And if you're afraid of commitment, or are one for variety; you're free to create more than one character, and if you only want one, there are some solutions (paid with real money, if you do it more than twice) to alter your appearance.

[h1]You can be anything you want[/h1]

Contrary to some most popular MMORPGs out there, FFXIV roles are clear-cut; tanks, healers, and DPSes. Tank are, well, tanks. They take the brunt of the damage from the party. Healers are here to take care of the booboos it and the party might take. DPSes... Hit. Make the runs faster, or slower, depending on how proficient they are.

Feel like rushing in before everyone and serve as a pillar? Play tank.
Want to feel real useful and do your good deed for the day? Go healer.
BigDPSBigDPSBigDPSBigDPSBigDPSBigDPS? Go DPS.

But let's say you've been playing DPS; and you don't like the role. 
[u] You're free to change your class anytime, anywhere you want.[/u] 
The only drawback is having to find other sources of XP to level your newly-chosen class. Still, the only limit is the number of available classes.

[u]And you can even choose the flavour of your role.[/u]
Standard wizard with fireballs? Black Mage, check.
Pure-hearted healer with the best of intentions? White Mage, check.
Edgy weeb with a katana? Samurai, check.
A mage with a rapier casting fireballs and fencing? Red Mage, check.
And with every class comes a new, fresh way to play the game.

[h1]The combat system is easy to learn, hard to master[/h1]

The game's skill or ability flow works with global cooldowns and off-global cooldowns.
Some abilities will trigger a general cooldown on your spells; which will leave you idle for some half seconds.

But as you gain in levels in a class, you learn some skills that you can weave in while you wait.
[u]The whole art of combat is learning how to use them at the right time, in the right order, in order to maximise your efficiency in terms of damage, healing or tanking. [/u]

Casual content does not require to be a monster at optimising; but the end-game (try-hard, hard-core scene, if you will) requires some degree of performance to clear.

[h1]Content? We have that, holy crap, do we have that[/h1]

The Main Scenario Quest (MSQ) will start slow. Very slow. It's going to be:
Go talk to that NPC. Go over there and talk to that one. Now teleport there, and speak to that one.

A Realm Reborn (First expansion of FFXIV) has not aged well, but sets the bases for the rest of the story. It will feel slow, and it's pretty slow.
But power through. Heavensward makes a wonderful job at summing up everything and gets you in the story.

[u]The MSQ unlocks most of the content.[/u] So power through, and you'll be rewarded with new dungeons, each different, epic boss fights.

[u]What if I'm done with the casual content? What is there more?[/u]

End-game content features some unforgiving fights that will require top-performance from your part and from your 8-man party. For a lot of players, the real fun begins once the MSQ is over, giving access to the end-game content with Extreme Trials (boss fights) or Savage Raids.

Those fights require high levels of coordination; if one player goes out of line, it's game over for the group. So you might want to find some peeps to play with.
 
[h1]And the people? Are they nice?[/h1]

FF players, in general, are very welcoming and kind. Many a times have I seen a person misplay its role, using a skill wrong, etc.
The tendency is: they'll always give a friendly tip. Or a small nudge in the right direction.

If you're looking for people to go through endgame content with; there are many veterans, and new players are flocking to the game today. There's always a guild willing to recruit you here and there; and some of them are even oriented (RP guild, casual guild, raiding...) A flavour for everyone.

Servers tend to be language-based, though it's not really written anywhere. If language is an issue for you, look up which server houses the language that's most comfortable for you.
But there is no exclusivity, and you can always find every language on every server.

[h1] And the game itself, in terms of graphics, sound?[/h1]

FFXIV 2.0 (we don't speak about 1.0) was released in 2013 on Windows. 8 years have passes since then, and inevitably, graphics have aged.

[u]I think the game offers some of the most beautiful landscapes I've seen in gaming.[/u] 
You will wander around places, marveling at the grandness of the decor around you. Your character will don well-detailed armour and clothes, and him/her moving around will give a sensation that he/she lives. Special props for the facial animations which add a layer of life. 
The spell and ability effect give birth to a bouquet of colours, providing meaty and substantial feedbacks to what you're doing.

 Given that the engine is pretty old I think the devs are playing their cards very well.

[u]And the soundtrack. My, the soundtrack.[/u]

You WILL bounce around in your chair. You WILL look some songs up on YouTube. The OST starts out pretty standard in the first expansions; but as the story goes by, Masayoshi Soken (FFXIV Lead Composer) takes liberties and does not hesitate to incorporate several genres in the game. You will hear some classic, epic boss music (Ifrit, Primal Judgement), some divinely-timed rock music (Shiva, Oblivion), and even some quick hip-hop (Alexander raids, Rise). If you have an ear for music and for variety, the game WILL provide.

[h1]With yet another expansion coming up, I'm still excited to play the game, even after 860+ hours. Really, it's your own FF story, with your own character, having fun your own way.[/h1]

"This game saved my life.

I am 69.

My ex-wife and I have a daughter together, and adopted our son together. They are now both 4 years old.

When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiralling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.

After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.

Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.

After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.

Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.

I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.

Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.

Thank you.",2021/05/28,2,0,0.52173912525177002,0

"Slogging through A Realm Reborn is the absolute worst part of this game, but once you are past that and all the world building is done, FFXIV is absolutely phenomenal. 

While ARR is a slow, disjointed mess, it's completely contrasted by the first expansion, Heavensward, which is a masterpiece storywise. It's also where you start to really experience the game; jobs start opening up more and get much more engaging and involved. 

The game slows down moving into it's second expansion, Stormblood, but it is still a really good story and expansion. The atmosphere and areas are gorgeous and are inhabited by interesting people that truly make the game feel like a living world. It is just in the unfortunate position of being placed between the 2 highlights of the game. 

Shadowbringers is the absolute highlight of the game and an absolute masterpiece in story telling. Going in knowing absolutely nothing about it is the best way to experience it. It's a story that will stay with me forever, bringing with it some of the best dungeons, raids and job actions in the entirety of the game. 

You get the ability to play both ARR and Heavensward for free on the free trial, with no time limits. If you're looking for a massive game to sink several hundred hours into, are a Final Fantasy fan or are just interested,  FF is one of the best MMOs out there.",2021/05/27,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0

"Good game (at least the expansion Heavensward is) but [b]do not play it on Steam[/b], just use the Square Enix launcher. The game goes on sale far more often on their launcher than it does on Steam, and owning the game on Steam provides no benefit whatsoever.

I just finished Heavensward (end of free/starter edition content) yesterday after 411 hours according to Steam. The remaining content, Shadowbringers, is still $40. It has been on sale twice on Square Enix's store since I started playing (it is currently $16 on the Square Enix store). If you play the game on Steam, you can ONLY buy through Steam.

"You'd think that a game that's been around this long would have solved several problems, and yet it hasn't.

Apparently when  going to collect some things for crafting, despite how powerful you actually are, you somehow forget /all/ concepts of defending yourself short of hiding and whispering ""Please don't see me"" over and over again.

Going from questing in a level 30 zone to getting killed regularly in the starter zone while gathering you may be tempted to think there's something wrong here. Fanboys of the game will tell you nothing helpful other than ""git gud"".

The forced solo missions for the quests, while an interesting idea, also level lock you to a specific level when you try it. If you're off your game at all on these, you're seeing a lot of resurrection screens.

Now for the actual review.

To me this game feels like one that requires more time than others. The leveling in this game is slower compared to games like PS02 and Star Wars the old republic, which isn't a bad thing! With all the content this game has and how fun and diverse the classes are, leveling doesn't feel like a drag. Instead it feels like getting used to your new class. The story is amazing, and the class stories are even better. The game feels rewarding and the community is pretty chill and accepting. Though I do got one problem and it's a realm reborn. It has many fetch quests and sometimes feels like a drag, but this can be ignored thanks to all the story elements involved and the side quest you get to do through the way. I'd recommend giving this game a try if you're into the final fantasy series, and if you're into MMORPG games.",2021/05/26,0,0,0,0

"As someone who has played WoW for at least 4 to 5 years (and finally hitting my limit with the game) I thought I'd come try out FFXIV. Needless to say I was blown away by how fun it was.

The re-playable content with level sync and ilvl sync is a great system for helping new players and leveling new classes. Speaking of, I love the fact that you can just play any class, any time, all on a single character.

The story, I will admit, was lacking in some parts for Realm Reborn and especially with Stormblood, but every other piece of the whole story through each expansion was amazing, after beating Shadowbringers I can say it was by far my favorite part.

[Mild Spoilers]

Realm Reborn was a modest start with a pretty dramatic end, Heavensward story had impact after everything that had happened. Stormblood was okay, but it failed to capture my full attention for most parts, the content however was pretty good. Shadowbringers had me pinned down the most, with plenty of dungeons, fights and an incredible story.

With nearly 700 hours (with the inclusion of the free trial time) I can say that this swiftly became my favorite MMORPG. Goodbye WoW.",2021/05/26,1,0,0.504269421100616455,0

You frustrate...But when you get your first real job..The game exploads in a way i cannot explain..It makes all that pain worth it. This game is like a slow roasted pork..You wait and wait and wait and all the sudden its the most wonderful thing in the world.- THAT ASIDE. Lets get too it. COMMUNITY = The best thing ive ever seen. Helpful. Caring. Kind. Chill.- GAMEPLAY = Hard. Interactive. Fast. Tricky/hard. A normal dungeon is harder then any (mythic) level content you would ever hope to find in WoW. The gear sets all have work and blood put into it. No recolor bullcrap. Just good- unique clean looking gear. The game is by far...A gem..It is worth every hour and every penny. - PVP = WONDERFUL! It has GREAT fun and gameplay- equal. No gear gaps only skill. HOWEVER. The community is small so you have longer wait times (They are working on it). They don't make empty promises. They don't make you grind rep. They don't put you behind stupid gates to get races. They just give you the game- make you grind and work to feel the reward and its honestly the only true MMO left imo. I could write a book on this but all i can say is this. DO THE DAGGUM MAIN STORY QUEST. The entire game is locked behind it. I know that may -seem- frustrating.  However we have all been conditioned to CRAP stories like WoW..This game? No. It makes you love the world again. The characters- the story. They know how to make it pop and drag you back. 100 out of 10 would HEAVILY urge you to try it.,2021/05/25,0,0,0,0

"BEST Final Fantasy game of the ""new generation"" for me this game right now with everything that has to offer from ARR to Shadowbringer and next EW is the best blend of FF stories ever put in FULL 3D all around camera game. The world feels so full and great to play and discover. The more you play the better you feel all the care and work put on it. The team in my opinion created the best  mix of old ff 5 castles visit feeling mixed with ff7-8 technology like world for example.

PLAY IT, the begining used to feel slow because you didnt have a lot of skills but i understand they made the story progress faster for newest player or for people that are not attracted to wonder around for ages while leveling just to feel how the story, character and places are put together.

FOR REAL PLAY IT up to the end of the first expantion before stormblood and you will not get back ever again. If you like high difficult raids and bosses we got it all for you baby!!

LETS PLAY TOGETHER, great community! probably one of the best RN in the world of MMORPG and RPG ingeneral.

SO, lets get to it! DOWNLOAD IT and HIT LAUNCH!

"With over 2000 hours played it would be very strange if I didn't enjoy Final Fantasy XIV.

While the first 50 levels of the game can be quite boring you'll find a wealth of side content to engage with along the way. I personally took much longer than expected to get to level 50 much to the ire of my friends just because of all the things you can do. There's an entire Rogue-like dungeon with separate leveling, a collectable card game ala Gwent you can find npcs out in the world to play against, and just so so much more than I can list in a review.

Once you hit Heavensward (level 50+) the story and characters go from a C+ to an A. I found myself pleasantly shocked to find an MMO that delved into themes of what it means to be a hero, how nations erase and bend history to prop up the powerful, how healing and reconciliation isn't just exposing but tearing down these false narratives, what does peace really look like, why love is strength, and that's all just one expansion.

Final Fantasy XIV just might be the best Final Fantasy title for narrative and character development. Which is a big statement I know, but once you sink your teeth into this story you will constantly surprised by it.

All of that is to say nothing of gameplay, and while I thought I wasn't going to like Final Fantasy XIV at first, owing to it's more traditional style of MMO presentation, I found the game felt much more dynamic than I was expecting. You can see the Square Enix polish on full display here. Every job in the game feels unique and rewarding to play. The balance in the game is such that there's never a job that is so horrible it can't be played with more of a focus on an individuals ability to play their particular job well and understand the mechanics of the game.

Lastly, the community is probably one of the best I've seen in any current online space. Perhaps it's in part the game's design, with focus on working together and community. There is no ""us vs them"", no ""Horde vs Alliance"" here. You will almost certainly find someone who is at the same place in the game with you, and if you don't you'll find people who are eager to help new players learn the ropes.

With the game going free to play up to level 60 now I honestly think it's worth your time to check out. If it's not for you, then you've paid nothing for the time. If it is up your alley, then there is a lot you can enjoy for free here, only paying if/when you decide to continue the story past level 60.",2021/05/24,0,0,0,0

"This is a solid JRPG. Very fun and lots of cutscenes. Keep in mind that, while it is an MMO, it is not like other traditional MMOs. There is more focus on the story and your character. Group content comes in between and at end game. You can't just jump into end game, even at max level, like other MMOs, story needs to be finished first. The community is one of the friendliest I have ever met in an online game. They won't hesitate to help if you are having trouble. That being said, there are still jerks but the helpful people far outweigh them unlike other online games.

Combat might be slow to some but you get used to it, then your rotation just becomes second nature. The difficulty goes from casual with story and dungeon content, to hardcore with the end game Savage Raiding. There will always be groups willing to help you out and learn your Class. There are a lot of Jobs but the game does a good job of teaching you.

"I recent came back to FFXIV Online and it's been awhile since 2013.  Back then there was no flying unless it was done in the newer content and you got the Aether Currents.  I am not to far in to it but seems you can Fly now after a certain almost anywhere, and for that alone I am willing to play it again.  But honestly there are still some certain parts that might make me want to stop playing again, like being a Gopher.  Cause honestly your not even a Warrior, Hero, Bringer of Light, your honestly nothing but a Gopher go here, go there, do this, do that.  Oh wait rub this guys shoulders 7 TIMES.  Yes I am talking about the stupid Hildibrand Quests.  There's no exp just a few hundred gold and you do the stupidest things I gave up and blocked it, it's that stupid.  The Story is Really good when you do it but with so Many quests it gets bogged down and you wonder why your playing and did you miss something.  I hope it gets better but at this rate I might quit again.  Maybe for some you like that but spending day after day after day after day after day you feel like it's a job and your not even being paid for it and it quits being enjoyable.  The box that says recommend I would click no.  But I'll click yes cause there is some good qualities and some bad but be warned it's VERY Grindy.
  Ok so I put a few more hours in trying the Squad you get from your Grand Company and the only reason I attempted it cause the forum says it's a good way to level.  Well I am going to have to decline cause as I have tested this theory.  It has 4 battle tactics that your companions, pets, allies, AI's whatever you care to call them.  Independent, Defensive, Offense, Balanced.  An that kinda, sorta Dictates how they behave and some stats but not really mostly just life, damage and defense.  An I have to be honestly I think they really ruined squads.  Out of 18 DoW/DoM your squad consists of 1 Tank, 1 Heals and 2 DPS so squads is the same set up.  But they are so STUPID and whoever designed the Tactics or how they are controlled should be shot, flogged, fired, whatever you want to call it.  Out of a Rank 5 Defensive on the Conj(aka Healer) they heal you at 40 life or let you die.  Or else they heal you when your life is full and don't need it.  An instead of healing they tend to Clear debuff's BEFORE even healing you even if your dying.  Like seriously?!  So I got 40 life and the debuffs are more IMPORTANT then me dying, death or healing me?!  Honestly before I give them anymore money, subs or anything they need fix the squads or remove them company since they serve NO PURPOSE but to PISS you off HOW STUPID they are.  So I have decided to QUIT playing again and to NOT Recommend this Game.  I would advice people there are better other games out there and to pass on this.
  PS.  Just tested a theory, did level 32 and 41 dungeons just as a Test.  The Conj (aka Healing) also lets the other AI's die also so not exclusive to just you.  An she does it on 2 mobs up to 5 mobs.  An as money and ffxiv brings in you would (Think) they has some programmers that actually know what they are doing.  But I guess it's a long as people pay and buy their crap they don't give a crap about actually doing a good job.  Just more expansions, more money and Fuc everyone else.",2021/05/23,0,0,0,0

You only need one of two things, 1.) The Appropriate Expansion or B. The Appropriate Level. The subscription to play turned me away form this game for a while, but after playing for a few days, what's $14 a month? Lol. I recommend going to the Square Enix website and playing the trial which allows free play through the game until you hit level 35. When you hit level 35 you are still able to play, you just can't progress any further in levels or story. The community is extremely nice and helpful, more so than say GW2 or BDO. In my opinion, the only game that was close to as fun as this was BDO, but I would say I still prefer FFXIV.",2021/05/23,0,0,0,0

"I have been really trying to give this game a chance. I've played it for a few hours now and I am really struggling with finding a single thing to like about it. 

The graphics are horrible. I even added a bunch of mods and reshades to the game to make it look better and it still looks bad. Textures are very low resolution and the anti-aliasing they have in this game doesnt get rid of the jagged edges at all so it just looks really blocky.

Th combat seems extremely 1 dimensional. Right click an enemy so that your character is aware that that is the specific and only enemy you would like to attack at this moment in time. Then, walk towards the enemy and press a button, then wait for the global cooldown and press another button. Would feel a lot better if the combos actually skipped the global cooldown and felt like combos. Runescape has far better combat than this game.

Story is where I was disappointed as well. A lot of people tell me this game has a good story, so after a few hours of roaming around I do the first MSQ quest (MSQ is what the main story quests are called) and I delivered 3 pretzels to people. COOL STORY BRO NEEDS MORE DRAGONS! Literally.

I haven't noticed any music in this game. Maybe that is intentional, but other than the barebones city piano melody that plays on loop the music hasn't stood out at all.

I'm aware my impressions are a minority here, but it really shouldn't be so hard to find a single good thing about a game. I guess the one good thing I can say about it. which isn't even part of the game, is that there seems to be quite a few interesting mods and an active modding community. I guess a lot of people felt this game was bad too and decided to do something about it.",2021/05/23,2,6,0.363405317068099976,1

"As a veteran player of MMOs including but not limited to Ragnarok, Runescape, World of Warcraft, Ace Online, Champions Online, Guild Wars, Pirates of the Caribean, Puzzle Pirates, and Star Trek Online, I don't say lightly that Final Fantasy 14 is one of the top MMOs I've played. The craftsmanship that has gone into the game on many levels shines through; the game itself is a passion project for much of its dev team, and it shows. 

Writing: 
While the storyline of its earlier expansions is a bit dated, and the voice acting in the same somewhat stilted, the storyline is never less than decent even in its earliest active portions (A Realm Reborn). The storyline, writing, and gameplay comes into its own in Heavensward, with a compelling drama and political climate, multi dimensional characters, and allies/enemies you actually become invested in. The writing only gets better from there. 

Content: 
The world is absolutely massive. It's rich in lore that can be unearthed, has seventeen standard combat classes, one limited combat class (Blue Mage), eight crafting classes, and three gathering classes. Unlike numerous other games, there are no limits to the number of classes a character can learn; you do not have to make multiple different characters to experience play as an archer, a thaumaturge, and a warrior. 

This is both a strength and a minor weakness; a strength in that with a lot of work, you can enjoy a very great breadth of abilities and gameplay options. But this also means that there is an enormous amount of work involved in playing and building your character. There is a LOT to do; the Main Story Questline is a LONG business, and will send you across the world, into deep dungeons, floating islands, negotiating with monster tribes, delving into political intrigue, fleeing the law, settling disputes between nations, representing leaders, and battling extradimensional villains, all without ever straying from the 'mandatory' quest chain. The many mechanics that you will deal with will turn you into a minor expert in your class just as a matter of course. 

Then there's the unique system of increased difficulty dungeons: They're not the same, and not just because of difficulty increase. Returning to a dungeon on 'hard' mode will bring you to the aftermath of your last visit. Changes have occurred, usually as a direct result of your last visit. Rooms may be shattered or in disarray, enemies are often completely different, even the pathing to the various bosses might be altered. What was once a ghost temple may now be inhabited by beastmen, who took advantage of your earlier attacks to enslave the rest of the native denizens, with brutal consequences. Square Enix created something special, here, and they continue to support, tinker with, and grow this world on a regular basis. Like all final fantasy games, they're not just trying to give you a fight but tell a long, overarching story, and they do so quite beautifully.

My personal recommendation is for your first character, at least, do NOT take a level skip or a storyline skip. You do yourself a grave disservice. Relax. Immerse yourself in the game. Spend time asking advice on the Novice Network chat channel. Explore the world, enjoy the incredible environments that have been designed. Spend a little time after completing a dungeon to poke around and look at things. If you want to play another character later, after you've been through the storyline, a level or story skip isn't a bad choice, but let yourself experience the game before you go cutting large portions of it out of your way. 

I won't put arbitrary stars or numerical ratings against this game; everyone has different context and I'm not going to scream 'It's Over Nine Thousand!' because that would be silly and unhelpful. I will instead say I've invested several years into the game, still subscribe, and look eagerly forward to the next leg of the journey that SE has provided us. I fully endorse this game as an excellent purchase, and I feel that it is a standout representation of an epic fantasy setting to play in.",2021/05/23,0,0,0,0

Its a very social game with alot of really helpful people. there are some bad eggs but thats to be expected anywhere you go. the first expansion(vanilla) version of the game is quite cliche, how ever the character customization and interactions with npc's make it worth while. once you make it to heavens ward its where it gets really REALLY fun. aside from normal mmo stuff you can buy your own estate, or apartment, and have full range to decorate(my favotrite part) and making money to do things like that isnt really hard at all. for you transmog lovers there is no shortage of fashion scape as well as emotes minions and mounts to farm. the mount animations are a bit bleake for my taste but makes up for it in their actuall visual appearance. Some of the emotes are really rare as well as minions and are a must have to show off your hard work and willingness to grind. the game isnt a grindy game tho. its very lax with a small amount of competetive nature mixed in but besides that its simply fun and i look forward to playing it every day i get up and every time i get home from work.",2021/05/22,0,0,0,0

Two of our main Dev team members made a rock band. Okay, secondly, this story is very good. Not many cliche moments unless they fit. It's intricate and very good. The play style is pretty simple for beginners and the end game content has varied levels. You can go casual or you can sweat in savage. It's versatile and very welcoming to new people.

"Not to jump on the band wagon, but the story does suck you in given time. But if you cannot get past the first 50 levels of the game it is all right to put down. However with each expansion the world expands that much more and the level of mature concepts surprises me at times.

As for the combat, find a class concept you like and no fear of balancing. Only harsh negative is the dungeon finder problem all these games share when it comes to DPS. Myself switched over to a tank after getting into the first expansion

Keep in mind as well that the content you blow past is toned down. As the fights have been adjusted to improve the speed in which you can get to the end game. That also includes deleted quests and overall stream line. And even then it is a lot to get through. So do not rush it, just enjoy the story and gearing your character up via the fantastic glamour/dye systems.

And a final note, you do not have to do every side quest. As you can always come back to use them while leveling other classes while waiting for dungeon finder for DPS jobs.

All in all a fantastic tide over till the next big wave of next gen games.",2021/05/21,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0

Do not expect to keep this game when you buy it at a discounted rate because this game is a SUBSCRIPTION game that requires you to pay monthly after your initial purchase of the game.

"Before I get started with this review, remember that this is all subjective. I do believe that FF14 was once a very good game, yet when you step back and look at things, I can't recommend it in good consciousness. I can, however, recommend the free trial. And I greatly encourage everyone to play the trial and see for themselves.

--PROS--
-The best MMO on the market for most staple MMO features. Open world, graphics, GCD based gameplay, crafting and gathering systems, playerbase, content in terms of both quality and quantity. Many people call it the best MMO out there. And, for your traditional MMO, it's very hard to disagree.
-Constant content updates. New content comes out frequently. Several people see this as justification for the monthly subscription, as the money goes back into the game.

--CONS--
-The biggest, most drastic, and most glaring problem with the game is the price. On average, you'll be paying 14$ per month to play the game. As such, every drop of money you put into the game makes you feel as if you're on a time limit, and pushes you to play the game more so you don't waste your money. It's addicting. And it makes you want to keep spending money so all your previous work doesn't go to waste. Additionally, expansions are 40$ each. While purchase of the newest expansion adds all old expansions, being a constant player means you'll need to buy each expansion when they come out. 4 expansions currently exist. 160$, on top of the constant monthly fee, should raise a few red flags. While FF14 is by no means a bad game, it's exceedingly expensive. So expensive, that even though it is the best MMO, it's hard to justify that monstrous price tag. If you aren't willing to spend hundreds of dollars after the trial to keep going, then don't feel pressured into doing so.
-Simplification. At one point in the past, each class felt unique to play. Mechanics were complex, power varied greatly, and each class played it's own niche, specific role. White Mage and Scholar felt nothing alike. Summoner had to constantly micromanage their pets. Astrologians think on the fly to use their random card buffs to the fullest extent. Black Mages dump damage rollouts as efficiently as they can. Dragoons stick to a massive rotation. Warriors can do so much damage that they don't even need a healer. But... Ever since Shadowbringers cut the bloat from classes, they all have become much more similar to one another. Both White Mage and Scholar gain a three stack mechanic, with the former losing the need to manage MP as a core skill. Astrologian cards aren't impactful. Summoner pets are now just there to look pretty, serving more as stances that alter skills than pets to manage. Warriors no longer have the power to solo if the player is skilled enough. Dumbing down all the classes and making them similar to one another makes them drastically less fun to play. This singlehandedly ruined the quality of gameplay for me, leading combat to be a con in my eyes.
-Simplification. This time, in crafting. At one point, crafting was dependent on RNG. Never to the point where you would get screwed out of tons of money. But enough to keep the process as involved and thoughtful, requiring understanding of the mechanics to consistently craft high quality items. During Shadowbringers, the devs had the brilliant idea to remove RNG as a core part of crafting. The system was originally designed to keep crafting from being a system where you push a button to make an item like in every other MMO. Shadowbringers decided to make it so you can push a button to make an item via macro, completely ruining the system and defeating it's purpose.

At one point, maybe this game was worth it. But, as things are now, I cannot recommend spending the immense amount of money on this game that it requires. Questionable decisions by the devs and steady drain of my wallet have forced me to give up on this game. I regret buying Shadowbringers. I would urge others to avoid this game as well. The game has gotten worse. The MMO genre has become stale, and business practices like this one peacefully exist because they are the only option.

"This game seems really fun, but it constantly crashes. Probably every 1-10 minutes. I tried many fixes and they just don't seem to help out. I am running on a 2080super and 3900x if that changes anything. So I just bought it for 60 bucks, and due to the nature of the cdkey distribution I am unable to refund it.

GRAPHICS - 9/10 - uses my graphics card well (NVIDIA), looks smooth and only a few instances of dropping frames, otherwise almost flawless running it on almost max settings.
STORY - 4/10 - not massivly in love with the story, although i have been told it picks up, so we shall see
QUESTING - 6/10 - isnt acutely as boring as i was lead to believe, and there are lots to do as well as the story so good to see, reminds me of old-school SWTOR, quests everywhere.
PROFESSIONS - cant really comment on how it is, although from what ive seen it being important is really kool to me, and i will invest more time as i go into it.
CLASSES - Again havent playied enough, from what ive seen from my thaumaturge has some really good powers, as well as teleport so useful.

UI eeh not in love with it, not amazingly happy with changing armor/clothes when doing professions seems very annoying, although i can see why its done.

The story is good and gets into some really complex political arcs at some points and I've been overall legitimately impressed with some of the themes the game brings to the table, stuff I would never have expected out of a fantasy-esc game like this.

When you come from games such as Grand Theft Auto Online and League of Legends, it seems hard to find a community so willing to teach and inform new players. FFXIV however, seems to be the black sheep amongst the crowd. Everyone is so nice and willing to teach new players, often called Sprouts, how to play their class or what to do for boss mechanics. The willingness to share information is great because it promotes better behavior and it sets people up for the future.

2. Excellent Story and Soundtrack
What else do I have to say? This is a Final Fantasy Game. Stellar music from the one and only Masayoshi Soken. We have bangers like A Long Fall, Who Brings Shadow, To The Edge, Return to Oblivion, and many more. The story is great as well, taking off from the end of 1.0 and into A Realm Reborn. Once A Realm Reborn is finished, you get sent directly into Heavensward, Stormblood, and finally Shadowbringers with Endwalker coming later this year. It leaves you on your seat with engaging characters such as Alphinaud, Alisaie, Thancred, and Y'shtola, that follow you along this over 7 year long journey. 

3. Fantastic End Game Content
You have a variety of things to do once you finish every MSQ. You can start working on alternate jobs as soon as you unlock your first job, work on raiding in statics, get started on crafters and gatherers, maybe work on your character's glamours, or even begin to build up a reputation as an AFK wizard. But all jokes aside, you do have a lot of things to do. Grand Company Ranks, Hunting Logs, Beast Tribes, Roulettes, Gold Saucer, Mount Farming, Deep Dungeons, Relic Weapon Grinding, Savage / Ultimate Raiding, Extreme Trials, and Unreal Raids are among many other things you can do in this game. Hell, you can make your badass Paladin in their all white armor suddenly look like you just came from a nice day at the beach. There really is a lot of things to do in this game.

Even though I love this game, there are several key takeaways I've noticed while playing this game.

1. Main Scenario Quest Required
The fact that most of the content is locked behind the MSQ is absurd. I understand that the story progresses along, and The Warrior of Light goes into these insane dungeons, trials, and raids in order to bring peace back to Eorzea. I understand that, yet it still feels forced having to go through over 500 MSQs in order to get to the fun stuff. Nearly all the fun things in this game, both hardcore and casual, are locked behind at least Level 50 MSQ. Not only are you unable to play most of the content without finishing MSQs, you won't even be able to do Job Quests unless you've beaten certain MSQs. 

2. A Realm Reborn As A Whole
One of, if not, the best ways to hook new players into the game is with the introductory gameplay. Most players will play a haphazardly put together game for at least a good portion of it even if the rest of the game is hot garbage. FFXIV however, is the complete opposite of those games. A Realm Reborn is the worst example of what this game really is about. First 30 or so MSQs feel like simple fetch quests or ""kill x amount of enemies"". As the game progresses, it's easy to realize all the other things you could be doing, which help to alleviate this issue. However, most of them are locked behind the higher levels (ie. Eureka, Bozjan Southern Front, Extreme Trials, Treasure Maps, Savage Raiding, etc).

3. Solo Players
This game is so much fun when you have friends. That isn't my concern however. My concern is when you don't have friends to play with. As a seven year old MMORPG, the game is very balanced with a lot of content to do. The downside is when you notice that a lot of them are instanced or outright require multiple people. This wouldn't be much of an issue when playing during the day and there are many players online all queuing for roulettes or are farming glamours and equipment. During the night is when it gets really difficult to do any solo content. Most players tend to have their own group of friends on at this time which allow them to bypass the queuing system. To combat this, Square Enix has introduced a Party Finder system where you can search for others trying to gather members for certain instances or create your own. The sad truth about a lot of this is that you end up waiting over an hour if it's an uncommon instance, or you end up having to play with people who clearly have no idea what they're doing and refuse to listen with an overall stubbornness to selfishly DPS.",2021/05/19,2,0,0.523809552192687988,0

"After 10 years of play the game still offers content to keep you engaged. For a MMO it covers all the check boxes a majority of players seek out, a true mmorpg. It has vastly detailed content that covers any player's style. Crafting sub sections, dungeon crawling, side questing & exploration, endgame challenges, casual to hard core play and even a casino area for fun mini games. Economy or Marketboard varies per server but in general it is well rounded and not impossible to utilize from the beginning of the game.

"This game has been an absolute godsend for me. I left WoW after being tired with how backwards the dev team has been.

In FF14, the story is the most important thing as you level: everything is gated behind unlocks through the Main Story Quest (MSQ) or through side quests. This includes: Dungeons, getting your first mount, mount speeds, fighting companion, etc.

While this game does have a good endgame, the journey to that endgame is important. Expect to be going through the MSQ for a month or more just to reach the end of the story so far.

One of the biggest draws to this game is the class/job system, in that every single class/job can be done purely on one character, which allows an attachment to this character to form.

If you are on the fence about playing this game, there is a free trial to level 60 (which includes the first expansion) with no time limit, so pick it up, enjoy it, level all jobs if you want.",2021/05/18,0,0,0,0

"This game is my first MMO, and I switched over to the PC version after beating the second expansion on my PS4. The console version was great, so I was hesitant to switch, but the PC version has absolutely delivered. As for the game itself, the story is incredible and easily one of my favorites among all the games I've played. It does start off slow, even with the re-worked Main Story Quests in A Realm Reborn, but when it gets going it does not let up for a moment. The playerbase has also been extremely welcoming and kind, and as a healer I have always felt like a welcome addition to any party I've joined. If you're wondering whether an MMO is for you, by all means give it a shot -- I would never have seen myself playing one, yet this game managed to lure me in and keep me hooked.

"so at the time of reviewing this game I have almost 1000 hours worth of game play and many would think that an adequate amount of time to fully know a game, well not for Final Fantasy XIV. I have played this game from around the middle of the 3.X content release and as much as i loved the Heavensward expansion this game just keeps on giving and giving and giving, I have barely even scratched the surface and i am constantly finding new stuff to do, this game is without a doubt the greatest MMORPG in recent years, eclipsing WOW and the other big MMO's on the market. 

The pinnacle of this game for me has been the ShadowBringers Expansion. Everything from music, game play, crafting and the myriad other content to complete has made it my absolute favourite MMO and I have been playing MMO's since the early 2000's, so I'd like to think I know a thing or two about MMO's. 

I can wholeheartedly recommend this game to MMO veterans and new players alike, I can even recommend it for people who have never played an MMO before. I cannot wait to see what new heights this game is taken to with the Endwalker expansion, this is a 10/10 for me.",2021/05/18,0,0,0,0

"I played the game back when it first came out and didn’t think much of it. Coming back almost a decade later I will say it is the best MMO on the market. 
Now note that it does require the users to be ok with a few things.
1: A slow start, you won’t have many moves and the game won’t be very complex.
2: You’re ok with this basically being a single player final fantasy game for a couple hundred hours.
Everything is locked behind the Main Story Quest (MSQ) and I would say including all the expansion the story is about 15% awful, 50% ok, 25% great, and 10% amazing. After having played up to the current patch it was worth it and makes the up coming content well worth it. Most of that 15% was in the first 50lvls and after they change the English voice acting for the rest of the game it becomes a lot less painful. 
Unlike some games this one had a plane for it’s story and it doesn’t feel tacked on, events play into other events, characters come and go, the main cast isn’t plot proof and we’ve lost a few along the way. This game is worth your time if you have the time to put into it. 
Also you might want to run an off healer or tank to avoid some slow DPS queues.

Also unlike WoW old zones + crafting materials are not useless as soon as the next expansion comes out. Not to mention crafting is actually worth your time in this game. 

Leveling all classes on one character is nice. It seems like your character actually gets stronger each expansion as well, which is not really the feeling in WoW.

"[h1] A Faith Restored [/h1]

After finishing the A Realm Reborn pre-patch content, I can safely say that the community I have met whilst adventuring in Eorzea is one of the best communities I have had the pleasure of becoming a part of. The Overall I have not had a negative experience anywhere. Even the parties found in the Duty Finder for dungeons have been really pleasant folks to play with. If you don't know the mechanics to a fight, as long as you are clear that this is a virgin run, and you are new to the game, you will be assisted in learning them. 

The mentor system in this game works quite differently than what I have seen in previous MMOs. This mentor system, is more community based. As a new player you will get a sprout next to your name to signify that you are new.  It is fine to be new, but experienced in the genre there is ALOT, and I mean ALOT to learn. Outside of just the mechanics to bosses and dungeons you also have to learn your Job, there's plenty of them, and from the few that I have managed to sink my feet into all play radically different from each other. The best part is most everything in the game is given and explained to you as you progress. As a new player to the game, but experienced in the genre, picking up on the basic moving around at combat will be the easy part. Sinking your teeth into things like the Materia system, Glamours, and the ability to have one character do everything [b]will be overwhelming!!![/b] Learning it in a slow drip through side quests will make the information dump much more manageable.

Progression isn't tied to your Job level, it is, but it isn't. Mostly you progress through the game's Main Story Quest which will give access practically everything. There are quite a few important systems within the game tied to either the Main Story, or a side quest. The side quests that do have something like that attached to them is very recognizable though. The exclamation mark will look different from a normal side quests, or the Main Story Quests.

While a lot of this may seem like a bit of a pain of an ass by comparison to being handed EVERYTHING all at once, and being expected to 'just get it' or look it up. A Realm Reborn is a slough especially for like the first thirty or so job levels. After a while though, the story picks up, the game play picks up, once it peaks though, it's a fast ride until the Patch Quests (which I haven't even touched yet) from what I've told it's can be a slough too, not as much as it used to be though.

I can't really speak on much as far as the other expansions are concerned, I may add on to this review as I get to the end of them, make revisions, and the like along the way. I will say it's been one hell of a three hundred hours thus far, and I'm liking where everything is going, and can't wait to get into Heavensward!!!",2021/05/18,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0

"Final Fantasy XIV is a fantastic MMORPG to pick up and play. I can't think of a single negative thing to say about the game, minus perhaps one thing. I'll list off things most MMORPGs have a problem with and why FFXIV does not have a problem with it. 

Grind - there isn't much of a 'grind' in ffxiv. Unless you really want the mounts that come off of the extreme versions of fights or are super into the raid content, there really isn't. You don't need the best possible gear to beat the game. There are constantly servers with the 'preferred' status that gives a huge boost in exp to new characters placed on that server. There is a roulette system called leveling roulette that gives a huge, level scaling exp bonus that makes it possible to level classes without having to kill one mob after the other or going into the same dungeon over and over again. 

However, you must be at a certain 'item level' to enter certain dungeons. This can become a problem, however it never did during my time going through the story. So long as I rolled need on any items I needed on the dungeon I was currently on, and picked up items I needed from the main story questline, I was never at an item level that was too low to enter a dungeon.

Class availability - Unlike games like WoW and Wizard101, one character can be every single class in the game. You're free to swap between classes as you'd like.

Race stat bonus - it doesnt exist. Some races have a very, very, very minor stat bonus to certain stats but it, quite literally, does not matter. It is so negligible that I considered not even placing it here. However, it's something a lot of MMORPGs have and I'm glad this game does not. 

Long waits for old content - also, doesn't happen much. If you're a dps you're going to get long waits(15 minutes at worst during peak hours) regardless. Because there are far fewer tanks and healers to dps that normally queue. Because of the roulette system, there is a constant flow of people going into new and old content. I've run the first dungeon in the game so many times I can't count anymore because the leveling roulette placed me with new players. It's great! I love being able to help out new players in their first steps into the game. 

Community - I've never met an MMORPG with a better community. Yes, you will end up with some jerk in your party at some point who will use the line 'you don't pay my sub' and continuously wipe the raid because  they think they know what they're doing when they don't. But the times that this has happened to me, in my 3000+ hours of playtime, has been, 3 times. 

Drop rates - I hear absolute horror stories about the drop rate of mounts in other MMORPGs but it isn't terrible in ffxiv. The only time you wont see a mount drop at least decently often is when the mount was released with the current patch or the patch before. That being said, it's based on a roll system and whoever rolls the highest gets the mount. People cannot roll for the mount if they already own it however. But this can lead to some serious bad luck. That is where the totem system comes in, where if you, unfortunately, manage to go 99 runs of a trial without getting the mount, you'll have 99 totems (1 per successful run) to buy the mount with. 

Class balance - currently there is no class that is objectively better than another. You, of course, don't want two dark knights on the same static for hardcore raiding. Or two monks, dragoons, paladins, etc. But it also really doesn't matter much. You loose utility you don't need in everything except some of the hardest content in the game where it is needed. Quick note: the content I'm talking about is exclusively optional. There is no reason to do it other than cool looking mounts/weapons.

Those seem to be the problems most people look for in mmorpgs. It's very important to know that if you're looking for the bad in something, you're going to find it. You can't be an ass in a dungeon and be surprised people are being an ass back to you, then call the game toxic. This is something I see way too often in the people that claim this game is toxic. I've had 3 toxic encounters in my 3000+ hours playing this game and I'm one of the people who runs the hardest content in the game.

Continuing on..

The music - god I could go on and on about the music. It's absolutely fantastic. There isn't a soundtrack in the game I can say I hate. There are some pretty amazing bangers as well. I really wish I could name some without spoiling things but I can't, you'll just have to find out for yourself !!

The story - all of the expansions have a fantastic story. I'd say my least favorite is the base game story however. It's not terrible by any means, but compared to the three expansions that come after it, it's very much sub-par. All I have to say is that if you like the base game, you'll go nuts after you get to the expansions.

The devs - The devs put so much obvious love into this game. There aren't many bugs you'll find that have persisted for a great length of time. In fact I can't think of any. I've never once encountered a game breaking bug. They're always looking to the players to see what they could add or remove from the game. Recently, they announced they'd be adding female/male versions to the two gender locked races of the game because the community wanted it. That's not something that happens often that I've seen. Every part of this game has an intense amount of love put into it and its obvious to anyone who plays the game.

The price - The base game is $20 and buying the current expansion buys you all the previous ones as well. You, quite literally, cannot buy Stormblood because it's now bundled with Shadowbringers. It's $40 for all of the expansions. Soon, Endwalker will release and then you will no longer be able to Shadowbringers as it will be bundled with Endwalker. The sub itself is $13 a month, with a dollar increase with every sub 'tier'. The tiers do NOTHING except allow you to have more characters on the same server. With the base sub you can have 1 character per server. Note: there are roughly 8 servers per data center so you can have 8 characters on the same data center without paying extra. 

Mounts - Roughly 95% of the mounts can be obtained in game. This, unfortunately, does not include mounts that were available through events and limited time offers. I'm mentioning this exclusively in regards to the fact that most mounts cannot be bought with money. Mounts that are available to buy with money are mounts you cannot get through any other means however. 

The free trial - It lasts for 60 levels and goes through the first expansion of the game. Yes, the first expansion is free. However there are major downsides to staying on the free trial for this long. You cannot add friends (however other people can send you friend requests), you cannot send direct messages to people(however other can send direct messages to you), you cannot mail other players, you cannot trade with other players, you cannot use the party finder (different from the duty finder), you cannot create parties of your own, you cannot join a free company (guild), etc. 

Game mechanics - the mechanics are ever changing and slowly grow harder as the game goes on, there's never a point where I believe the game grows repetitive as new dungeons and content always has the player on their toes. 

The one thing I believe this game has a major issue with is the pacing at the beginning of the game. It's slow in the beginning and it can really turn people off to the game. But for aspiring new players I highly suggest staying at least through the game's first trial and then making your final judgement as that is when the game starts to really pick up.

In short, the game is truly a masterpiece. There isn't a game I'd recommend more than Final Fantasy XIV and I genuinely hope this game lasts for a very, very long time. It truly is deserving of all the praise it's been given.",2021/05/18,0,0,0,0

When it comes to that here is no beating ffxi, specially when it comes to party and how organized it is, in ff14 is a massive cluster ball of crap all over the place with no tactical order or tactical positioning, like thf doing SATA behind tank, ffxi, and so on.

Jobs system means no grinding out alternate characters. Make and keep the one you enjoy and level all the classes on them. No alts for banking or sloppy inventory management. No bags to buy and swap. Teleporting to major cities and a the Aetheryte system and smooth and helpful. Glamour has never been more awesome than it is on FF14. Design build and wear whatever outfits you want easily and switch between them at will.

This game has something for everyone and unlike it's big competitors like WoW and such they actually give a damn about enjoying their game instead of mandatory hours of mindless grinding each day/week.

"This game has a good story, pretty strong class leveling system with loads of opportunity to grind with no single class lock in the create a class, but takes time to sink in if your new and actually want to enjoy the MMO, the combat is not bad, but too much skills being cycled out in favor of new ones, even when some of these skills being replaced weren't so necessarily old, raids depending on who you ask or what you read online, always an 
 iissue, maybe not what people tend to look for a hardcore kinda game activity, money tends to be problematic since its all player operated, and the player can decide what holds value and what doesnt, no other alternative form of selling in this game as Sqaure Enix does not really support NPC interaction on that deep of a level, if your used to MMOs where your used to selling gear at NPCS for fast money this game isnt for you. Also the option to sell things to NPCS is there, but dungeon loot isnt as large like in other games where players find a bunch of stuff to choose from to see what can improve their class and sell off the rest mentality. Also, if your a fan of home aesthetics this game really is not for you, because at times you will have to fight off several people at times to own a new home if it's in a really popular location or just happens to be in a scenario where the development team have only a number of wards for the growing number of players. And when you finally win Marvels Avengers Civil War for the new home, it comes with a big expiration date on it depending on how long you decide to play the pay to play video game. so, IN SUMMARY play at your own mental risk, because this game might not be something to enjoy in the long run besides story progression.",2021/05/17,1,0,0.500548839569091797,0

"Will post an update once I get to end game. I've been leveling Pal/Glad, Arcanist, and every profession to level 30 so I can't give a fair evaluation of the end game content but so far I absolutely love this game.

I had originally purchased the game in 2017 but struggled to get into it. I leveled a character to level 5 and stopped. This year I decided to give it the ol' college try and am glad that I did. 

Graphics:
Amazing, I think the combat and visual graphics are beautiful.

Combat:
Is fun once you get to level 20ish+ because you don't have a lot of abilities that chain so it feels like you're spamming the same 2-3 buttons. I started as an arcanist but got bored because of that reason and switched to a gladiator so I could tank. I've specialized it into a paladin and am having a blast.

Crafting:
This is probably my favorite part of the game so far. I've always been huge on crafting my own gear and being self sufficient. The ability to be every crafting profession allows me to create or gather every piece of material that I want. I have logged 10-12 hours just gathering stuff haha. There are abilities and combos that you can do to create higher quality items or base ingredients that helps you craft nicer quality gear. It's just fun IMO, some might think it's tedious but I absolutely enjoy it.

Will add more updates once I hit 100 hours or max level on the paladin, which ever comes first.",2021/05/17,0,0,0,0

Played this in 2014, I hated it. It took two hours to get out of the first city, and it was all run around delivery and fetch quests. Went back to World of Warcraft.

Me: ""Fuck no that game sucked."" 
Wife: ""Lets try it.""

"The game is so good and has so many aspects that I'll just try to guess the FAQ

[b] tl;dr [/b]
Worth the monthly fee, go for it!
(I thought as well that it's a money trap, but it definitely is worth the money trust me)

[b] Is the game alive? [/b]
Yes

[b] Is it really ""the best MMORPG"" like people say it is? [/b]
Depends on what you expect, but it got me and lots of people addicted, so... I guess..?

[b] How is the community? Is there a clan system? [/b]
Community is for some reason pretty cool. I haven't came across much toxicity at all.
There is a clan system, called ""Free Companies"" (often referred to as FC).
There are also crossworld linkshells and fellowships, which kind of expands the community if you're into that, but I don't know much about them.

[b] It's probably not a FAQ, but is there a housing system? [/b]
Yes, a pretty good one too, but also can get real costy. You can do massive parties with lots of people, or just hang out with few friends. Pretty cool!

[b] How does character customization work? [/b]
I spent an hour or so for both my character designs (I still have only one char), so I'd say the character customization is a little decent, but then again, I spend that much time on every character creation. It's not really detailed unlike it's rival from it's neighbor country Black Desert Online, but it's still good
There's a system called ""Glamours"", which extends the outfit customization. However, to get really good looking outfits, you [i] may [/i] have to grind for a while.

[b] Talking about the grind, how long is the grind in this game? [/b]
Quite long, I'm 250+ hours in and still haven't unlocked every feature from first two free expansions yet (That really depends on person tho)

[b] What is the gameplay like? [/b]
Do not be fooled from the first 25-50 hours of the game; the gameplay can get real complicated. In the first levels, I'd say until 40-50, the gameplay is usually just pressing specific buttons over and over again.
After a while though, the game will start throwing stuff at you and you will have to really understand how your own class works to make the best out of it, and you'll struggle while adapting to that. And it gets even more difficult, but you will also get even stronger as well. However, the stronger you get, the more you'll be required to understand your class.

Besides PvE/PvP, the game also offers different classes that have much more different gameplays: Crafters and Gatherers. Although I still haven't gotten to work with those classes that much yet, I can say that they really are fun.

I can keep going about the gameplay but that'll make the review look like a novel",2021/05/16,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0

As if all of that wasn't enough, the story no short of award deserving, your character will go through many challenges with a really charismatic cast and if you get all the way into Shadowbringers i'm 100% you won't regret it because that storyline hits HARD.

"This is a good-looking game and the combat and class builds can be fun, but there is SOOOO much wasted space in between the fun moments that I can't bring myself to keep playing. The main story quest is loaded to the brim with non-optional fetch quests that will see you holding ""W"" for hours while your character trudges back and forth across the map in no logical order whatsoever. The ""story"" as far as I can tell consists of filler dialogue to justify all the meaningless quests (did I mention that are required to advance the main story) and fun content is gated behind your progress in this seemingly endless chain of tedium.

"Great story that takes ages of slogging through garbage to get to. Once great gameplay that has devolved to become barely mediocre and continues to become worse for each expansion that releases. Worst community on Earth.

Story gets good after literally 40+ hours of gameplay. That is even after they changed 2.0 to trim some fat. 40+ hours. Sure, when you get there it is great. That does not change the fact that you really have to want to get there to get there. Oh, and any and all content is story gated, so good luck getting a hesitant friend to play with you.

Gameplay used to be great. Great combat system with nuance, great diversity in combat classes, fun and interactive gameplay for all jobs, not just DPS. Not sure why, but most of that diversity was completely scrubbed away in 5.0 where they streamlined all of the Tanks and Healers to do essentially the same thing and play very similarly. So if you like tanking or healing, watch out. Neither role is fun in this game, which might explain the 30+ minute queues DPS players have to deal with.

The community of this game is filled with some of the most vile and disgusting subhumans you may ever have the displeasure of interacting with. If you have played League of Legends, it is basically the opposite end of the spectrum. The community and devs coddle and cater to the lowest common denominator. That means you can get banned for harassment for simply asking the DPS in your party to do their AOE rotation. Honestly these people are probably why the combat was dumbed down and simplified to the point that an egg could play the game. And the cherry on top is that even now that the combat is so simple, they still refuse to play as if they have more than 3 braincells. 

Now what I described is the worst the community has to offer. There are some decent people like with any game, but they are absolutely not worth the interaction with the degenerates you would have to go through to meet them.

Despite all the terrible things I just said about this game, I want to like it. For fuck's sake I have 2500+ hours clocked in on it. I just wish it hadn't gotten to the point where I resent it this much for changing into this thing that caters to the worst kind of person. I still have my finger on the pulse of XIV in hopes that the game will change for the better, but I am doubtful. Hopefully Endwalker is a pleasant surprise.",2021/05/15,15,3,0.499878525733947754,0

"[h1]This is the worst videogame I have played in my entire life. Without exaggerating. Hear me out.[/h1]
The FORCED main quest has you teleport spam around for 40+ hours straight without distractions, literally all you do is Teleport around the globe like a maniac. this is So soulcrushingly horrible to endure that it has eradicated ALL traces of actual gamers from the game, and only Socials are left who simply bought a boost for 18 bucks to skip it, hence Every single guild just being a social circle for social shit and social identity stuff, instead of being about Playing the game.

If you want to just walk into an MMO town and complete the quests there, do not play this ""[i]game[/i]"", you will kill 1 mob, teleport across the globe,  talk to someone, teleport across the globe, pick something up, teleport, global teleport, global teleport, global teleport ([b]I am not joking, and cant possibly exaggerate this[/b]). It makes absolutely no sense from a game design standpoint. Keep in mind this  terrible quest chain is FORCED and tied directly into your progression. Not only can you not avoid it - you cannot realistically do any of the neutral, less soul crushing side quests because you are already around 10 levels above the main quest as it is, single-spamming it.

The [b]one time[/b] I was allowed by the tyrannic main quest to do multiple quests in a single area, This single main-quest-chain sent me down into the Same area 8 (!!!) yes 8 times in a row ([i]mercifully only sending me with a global TP to talk to some npc on the other side of the globe a single time in between[/i]). Imagine in WoW some dude in Goldshire sending you deep into the same kobolt cave 8 times in a row, with a random Darnassus NPC chat in between - that is unironically the single best quest you can expect in this game - all the rest is simply ultra-spamming teleports between random cities and single mob kills/npc chats. Do not believe people who tell you it gets better. If it did - [i]it wouldnt be worth it[/i], but there is no light at the end of the tunnel. there is no good pvp worth raiding for, there is No cool mmo economy worth grinding for, there is nothing. it aims to be nothing more than a social bubble with an upsetting amount of furries.

Now that I've got almost 4k hours on record, I can confidently say that this game is a great game. And I'll tell you what I like about it.

- You can get very class to max on a single character, no need for hundreds of alts if you don't want them. 
- Content is frequent, but never at a breakneck pace that is impossible to keep up with. Some would argue it's a bit slow, but that's not necessarily a bad thing either. 
- There is always, always, ALWAYS something to do. 
- The crafting and gathering is actually lucrative and an argument can be made that playing the marketboard in this game is a game within itself. 
- The community is, for the most part, very kind and willing to teach.
- There can be a lot of tedious grinding, yes, but it's not as terrible of a grind as other mmos I've experienced. 
- Story is fantastic if you care about that.
- Getting good at a class usually feels rewarding.

"TL;DR below

There's a lot to FFXIV, and with my play time it's obvious I love the game. So instead of breaking down all the ins and outs I think it's probably better to focus on what I've found to be the most common factor in people loving or hating this game, and that would be the absolute centrality of the story to almost every core feature of the game. This game, while an MMO, is very much in every way a fully-fledged Final Fantasy linearly-presented JRPG experience and as such places immense importance on the story. And because every core system of the game (access to dungeons, raids, zones, etc) revolves around how far along you are with the story, the question of whether or not you enjoy that sort of storytelling or even if you want to focus on a story at all is probably a significant point of adoration and contention alike.

Want to raid? Ask yourself whether or not fighting in that raid would be enhanced with you knowing the backstory of the enemies and their arenas. Ask yourself if you'd be willing to go through tons (or nearly all, depending on which raid) of the main story quests to unlock them. With the main story quests in mind, are you ok with the early game (A Realm Reborn and its immediate post content) being on the slower side with the purpose being to build a thoroughly solid foundation for all of the higher quality storytelling to come? 

To reiterate: a lot of the quality generally spoken of comes from the payoffs that happen because of a familiarity with the entirety of its narrative and characters. The game *often* introduces side characters and small narrative threads that seem to be inconsequential at the time, only to have them come back in *major* ways two expansions down the line. You don't need to remember every little detail but the game very much respects the time spent engaging with its worldbuilding and storytelling. You'll still get quality gameplay for sure even if you ignore the story, but engagement with the story often takes a fight from ""that was fun"", to literal tears throughout while still enjoying the gameplay. And yes, the story is fantastic and truly gets better with time. One of the best stories I've ever experienced hands down.

If you like story and character driven games which give you more the more you invest in the worldbuilding and such, this is a must play! The long-form nature of an MMO paired with the utmost care in storytelling makes this game truly something else. A ten-year long story (and counting) that's actually very well written! Almost all fighting and gameplay (yes crafting included) is elevated because of the story. For instance: the current 8-person raid series (at the time of writing this review)  draws on a character introduced very early in the game and their relationship to you and other characters, as well as drawing upon a series of bosses found in the early game and their relationship to the metaphysics of the in-game universe, all while *further* exploring the mental and emotional state of this character. None of it feels out of left field, all of it feels deserved, and it makes the meaning of stacking up in front of point A in the arena to spread damage way more profound.

If you do not like longwinded and linear stories and/or JRPGs, this might not be for you. All content (zones, raids, dungeons, etc) is locked behind story progression so you will need to do many many quests to reach specific things. You can skip the cutscenes and rapid click your way through dialogue but you will still need to pick them up and complete them, often going back and forth across zones to do so. Though the combat is rather engaging and is fun in its own right, your willingness to engage with the story and your enjoyment of the story often directly ties into how much you get out of it outside of a purely mechanical point of view. There *are* job skips and story skips for sale on the official site, but with the above in mind you will probably be scratching your head jumping into current endgame content.

I'd still recommend trying it out if you're unsure whether or not you're on board with the above. The free trial is pretty huge in scope and will give you an adequate sense of the game as a whole. For those who are ok with story gating content but are unsure of the quality of the narrative, please do keep in mind that the pacing and quality picks up significantly with the Heavensward expansion (which is included in the free trial). I know, I know, EVERYONE says that. But it's the truth.

TL;DR:
If you like and crave story and are ok with everything being gated by it, this is the MMO for you.
If you dislike being forced to go through a story and want to jump straight into current endgame content, this MMO is probably not for you.
If you're unsure, the free trial is expansive and will give you a good sense of the game.",2021/05/15,8,0,0.605013191699981689,0

"Final Fantasy XIV is the WoW for the current generation.

If anyone has been looking at ffxiv for a while now and have never given it a good chance, there is literally no reason to not give it a try. 
Because even as a Free player, you have access to all the classes and the content through the Heavensward expansion, and none of that content is locked for free to play players.
The Classes ""aka Jobs"" in the game are all very diverse and the more you dive into a class the more you feel like a master of said class. 
""but what if i don't end up liking the class i start off with."" 
Fear not, because after I believe level 15, you can go to any class guild in the 3 main towns of the game, and get a completely new class to play starting at level 1....so yes, you can have 1 character, with every single class in the game.

The Dungeons and Raids in the game slowly ramp up in difficulty, and even at lower levels are always engaging.
The Story starts off simple, but once you get to the expansions is where the fun and excitement truly begin.

The community is always inviting and is always welcoming new and old players. So if you are ever struggling with anything a simple question in the chat and your question will always be answered. 

This game has become one of my favorites of all time and ive tried many mmorpg's and none of them ever got close to my love and passion that i have for final fantasy xiv. I get that the idea of a monthly subscription or hell even the fact that we have cat people apparently scares off some people. I promise you, that your time and most importantly money is valued with non of it ever feeling wasted. With the main developer even encouraging that if people begin to feel like they are burnt out of the game, to simply stop and come back when they feel confident and ready to come back to this game.

"NOTE: Base game A Realm Reborn is going to be a huge thing mentioned in my cons. If your able to push through that, the game is actually really fun to play. 

I enjoyed the game. While I shit on the base game a lot, the company has really grown since the shitstorm of a launch they had years ago. The community is still thriving after all these years and I'm happy to be a part of it. From a random person running up to me to pet my Hrothgar character and run away, to the conversations I have with people in dungeon maps there were a lot of Pros, and Cons, that were in the game that I believe should be mentioned.

PROS:
- Game up to level 60 is free to all players, allowing you to go through the base game A Realm Reborn, and Heavensward
- Best class system that I have ever seen in any MMO. Instead of locking one character to one class, you can keep the same character and just swap classes.
- Heavensward up has really good story content and phenomenal dungeons and side quests. Characters are no longer cardboard cutouts after A Realm Reborn and actually have emotion in them due to the new voice actors.
- Community has a mentor status (the crown that shows on people's heads) and their sole purpose is to help out new players when they are having trouble
- Each Class is unique in its own way. While there are way more DPS classes, each class has their own job mechanics that help out other classes. Each class is easy to pick up and learn while also having a high skill level.

CONS:
- A Realm Reborn is a literal shitfest, story was uninteresting and you have to shovel through hours of story content to even get to the good stuff
- Tutorial holds your hand for too long, up to level 15 just to get out of your city and explore the world, even further as you go to each city in Eorzea to introduce yourself as the Warrior of Light.
- Some races like the Hrothgars and Vieras are locked behind a paywall. By purchasing shadowbringers you are able to play these classes.
- Some key features, like Glamour, Dyeing, or job quests are locked behind quests. Things need to be looked up to find where the quests are to unlock them.
- Character customization is lacking, especially in the new races. Hairstyles in the new races are locked behind faces.",2021/05/14,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0

If you want to cosplay as a weeb, then you can play samurai or ninja. If you wanna play a useless ranged DPS which buffs his team with nothing, then you have bard for the job (but he can play music). The amount of content in this game is pretty astonishing, even if you don't care about the story in any way at all. The bosses in this game drop really nice looking cosmetic items and some of the mounts are cool as hell. It does get boring once you finish end game content, but I think that you can find enjoyment just by chilling in Lower Limsa and looking at the amount of people there, all with different classes, cosmetics, races, etc. Most of the people in this game are really nice and if you're willing to talk to some child predators, weebs, and furries, you could make some new friends. To top it all off, if you're horny, you can be a cat or bunny girl. Oh but fuck grinding out levels and finishing the story.",2021/05/14,0,0,0,0
I've played this for a few hours and i would'nt recommend this if you have a life outside.....it is a time vacuum.....a black hole filled with different races and an amazing story. if you want to escape into what i personally think is the best MMO experience  you could have! the only let down is the housing system but other then that 10/10!,2021/05/14,0,0,0,0
"This is one of the best games I've ever brought it was worth every single penny and ive played so much more than my worth for my sub, the devs care so much for what we want, 10/10 game!!",2021/05/14,0,0,0,0
"Personally, I would have never expected myself to actually start and get addicted to a MMORPG especially a final fantasy game as technically this is my first game I’ve personally been addicted to after so long. At first, I didn’t have any expectations other than the concept of a game that is just a “grind” and not fun at all.

I have never touched a FF in my life and the only times I have been just me watching and just seemingly getting bored of it, the only types of FF I have seen in terms of what it is. Was simply the famous FF7 games with cloud and the ones with Lightning, those are the only 2 games that I have recollections about or even know about. I dislike games that are simply “grindy” but after 2 months or so with 360 hours, with my neko dragoon, The game itself can pull in even the most reluctant of players just from the story itself and the combat system.

Positives :
Combat system is very friendly to new players
Tons of content from the first 2 expansion as the free duration gives you 2 of the expansions which is basically the entire game by itself from the story alone
Soundtracks are phenomenal 
All the class can FIT in a single character, you don’t need to create alts to even try out different classes
You can immediately jump into end game content by getting to the max level and simply buying the gear on the marketboard with in-game currency or simply create them.
Amazing and friendly community
Expansion of mind blows the story to draw you in, awesome in itself.

Negatives
Simply the monthly payment of this game, you need the dedication and well the money to continue to play but worth the price
Big time investment.


In conclusion, this game is very worth it for both average and casual players.",2021/05/14,0,0,0,0

Farming for mounts and boss weapons are fun and upgrading them to their cooler looking versions makes you actually put effort into your crafting classes.

* Purchase base game + Shadowbringers dlc

Didn't run into any issues after.

Combat is at a good steady pace with plenty of things to do. I feel the buttons I press are meaningful decisions instead of just spamming every thing on cool down.

There's plenty to do in the game, almost too much, and It can be overwhelming at first. Best advice is pick a class and go through the story. afterwards you can explore crafting and other things.",2021/05/12,0,0,0,0
"I prefer FFXIV as a former WoW player. The jobs of each character is built off of classic RPG standards, which also means my character's skills actually mean something, especially healing.

The community is also great, in that you have to play your job. People will be kind most of the time and give you hints if you don't know. At Lvl15, I highly recommend you visit the NPC named ""The Forge"", available at every Adventurers Guild in the major cities.

"|MMO-Try Outs Review|
FINAL FANTASY XIV Online is a final fantasy mmorpg. You get to create your own final fantasy hero from about six races to start with and more two stuck behind dlcs. There is a bunch of classes/jobs to play as, and I was told that at some point you can change it at some point and they have class upgrades like in any other final fantasy game. The game is very story heavy. The graphics is very beautifull, and it has a day/nigh cycle. I started as a conjurer thinking you conjure elementals, but it's just a healer white mage, which i'm okay with too. I didn't think I would like it and I did find myself lose time while playing. There might be too many quests, it felt kind of overwhelming. I would definitely play more, but the monthly subscription kind of a turn off, through. And I give it a 8/10.

[hr][/hr]
[h1]Some initial pros:[/h1]
[list]
[*]Simple gearing - you do content and just roll on loot with your party. Item level is king and there is no need to sim your character outside of the game. Aren't winning loot? Lucky you, you recieve tokens akin to valor/justice points for completing raids and can just purchase gear.
[*]No addons- the game doesn't support addons and as such is designed [i]without[/i] the necessity of having them. That being said, the game does have a plethora of built in UI editing options. But essentially you won't need to install DPS/Healing/Threat meters, a boss mod package to raid, etc.
[*]No need for alts - any character can be an class and profession at any time. Your ""job"" or class is defined by what weapon class you currently have equipped. Your character can start learning how to become any combat class or crafting/gathering class at your will. No need to level alts just so you can have access to specific crafting recipes or cooldowns.
[*]Extremely nice community - I dunno how or why but the players in this game are EXTREMELY friendly. This was a complete culture shock coming from WoW. I messed up a mechanic as the healer in one of the early game dungeons and got pretty embarrassed as it should have been fairly obvious, but the chat filled up with jokes and encouraging messages as we prepared to go at it again. New players are distinguished with an icon beside their name and vets will go out of their way to help you.

Final Fantasy 14 is a slow paced game with an unfolding story that rivals those usually found in single player games. I encourage anyone not already into Final Fantasy to push past the initial ""lul weeb game"" sentiments that I also had.",2021/05/11,0,0,0,0

"One of the best Final Fantasies that there is! Final Fantasy XIV plays like an actual Final Fantasy entry in gameplay as well which is surprising because every other MMORPG feels like an MMO first and an RPG second, but this game offers everything any other MMORPG has to offer and in some cases more, as well as retaining the original feeling in gameplay and movement that a real Final Fantasy game has. It actually seems to control tighter and just in all ways feel better than your typical actual Final Fantasy entry. 

The feeling of playing FFXIV in general well, it feels than better than any MMORPG that I have played. There is an actual feeling of disconnect when playing the character of your typical MMORPG that isn't found in Final Fantasy XIV. Like an actual feeling of hollowness that is slight but present in the feeling of gameplay in every MMO that exists as a nature of the format. The difference in feeling between RPG to MMORPG is not found in FFXIV, in my opinion. Players of popular MMORPG's may know what I mean. 

All the beauty and wonder of a Square Enix title is not wasted here. You'll find all the trappings that hallmark this extraordinary and prolific series on display here in full-force. One also finds a faithful entry into a very well made and thoughtfully orchestrated Final Fantasy classic! It's like any iconic Final Fantasy game, except much much longer. 

The races are varied and fantastic. The clothing is divine. Final Fantasy XIV has style and grace pulled straight from the catwalk! You'll be pleased to see every little trinket you wear; necklaces, rings, bracelets, and even earrings all show up on your character, because this is Final Fantasy, this game is motivated to act from a place of beauty, gentleness, and with an attention to detail. They didn't cut any corners with this game!

Character creation is quite pleasing and emoting is quite satisfying. Your character can be found moving very fluidly throughout the world, which is a lifelike and soft and pleasing thing to the eye. 

Final Fantasy XIV is atmospheric and zen, I find it easy to stay calm and focused while playing FFXIV, even if the game makes me feel lost or frustrated, due to FFXIV's easy-going and pretty acting demeanor, it's all good. You may find yourself feeling kindly, enthusiastic, wistful, nostalgic or feeling quite sunny but a little shy while playing FFXIV. Final Fantasy is also able to spark one's sense of humor, so it's not only beauty and intrigue.

Classes or Jobs are all interesting. And while they are each filling the typical notches that all classical RPG's fill, they retain and originality themselves, with lots of character and diversity has been added to each class or job, and each job is intriguing, and one character can also play or learn the roll of every job if one wants. Yet one may only level up and gain skills and stats as one class at a time, so one may want to pick a class and stick to it, but the ever present feeling of freedom and choice is a nice feeling to have! 

Ever want to play the whole life of your Final Fantasy protagonist day-to-day instead of just moments of their life during a particular adventure? FFXIV delivers that!",2021/05/10,0,0,0,0

"The game starts out slow...

But I've never played a game with such a kind community, such an in-depth story, and engaging experience. I recommend this game to anyone. SE Doesn't just stop there though, they just did an event where if you purchased Butterfinger products, they put $50,000 toward those entries to the Children's Miracle Network.

"I recently started playing the game, and it's amazingly fun. As a big fan of MMO's it's  definitely ahead of most other MMO's, specially when it comes to the story quest and each of the class stories. You will certainly see the  same details, and interesting story line, with amazing cut scenes they gave previous versions of  final fantasy, with the bonus of it being an MMO, unlike most others that is just boring grind where you just want to skip through mundane quests and not even bother reading.  Thus far me and a friend have been playing from the start coop and we're having fun unraveling out class.

Friendly tip: the story line quest is the exclamation mark inside a yellow comet. Stick with that quest line, it'll level up you nicely with some nostalgia of the Final Fantasy franchise. As well as your class quest. 

If you decide to play using steam, you'll still have to make an account with Final Fantasy 14 Online before or after your download.  Link:

"I've played quite a few MMO's... WoW, Elder Scrolls, Destiny, Warframe, Aion, Blade N Soul, Black Desert, GW2. With that being said I won't be renewing another sub or dedicating my time to any other MMO's. The best part about this game is hands down the story. It drops you off at the start of your own story so you don't have to ""look up"" what's happened so far to begin the game. The dungeons HAVE PURPOSE, the Boss Fights ( trials) HAVE PURPOSE, the raids HAVE PURPOSE. Very few times did I feel like""why am I doing this this is dumb"" (aside from the obvious non story related content). To really rate an MMO you have to play to the first point of ""End Game Content"" for any given MMO with multiple expansions. For this game that would be lvl 60 and the first expansion Heavensward. If you aren't addicted to the combat, visuals, music and overall nostalgia this game brings from other FF games, it's not for you. PVP is an acquired taste and it just doesn't sit well in this game, HOWEVER...as someone who gravitates towards PVP in this game I've hardly had the drive to because of how much fun the PVE content is. I've had hours of fun just doing the Main Scenario Quest and dungeons and trials that go alongside it. 10/10 Would recommended to people who actually like to level and play MMO's. If you plan on putting in 5 hours of game time to review it go play another category of games. This is an MMO and it's massive and it's ment to take time to appreciate. 

GAMEPLAY : 8/10 ( 2 second GCD is a pain but off GCD combo's make it better)
STORY: 10/10
PVP: 5/10 Needs work. 
PVE Content: 10/10 You like FF Boss fights and cinematic fight scenes with pumping music in the BG???

"I recently left WoW after putting up with Blizzard's antics and all around abuse of it's player base. I enjoyed Shadowlands when it dropped but upon recent events it has become all to apparent that Blizzard no longer cares of its players and just wants to milk them dry. So imagine my shock after years of that abuse, when I finally take the plunge into FFXIV and find that a vast majority of the content free off the bat. That's not even getting into the gameplay, the visuals, the soundtrack, the story, and the all around player experience. 

FFXIV has absolutely blown me away so far and the further I get into it, I feel more and more at home. I can't remember the last time I was excited to get home and start playing a game. This game is a warm fire in a dark night for a WoW refugee like me. Thank you, Square and most of all thank you FFXIV community for being as welcoming as you have been.

"If you have no filter, very bold, and not a sensitive snowflake who is easy weak against words. This game might not be for you, profanity or any kind of trolling bullshit you do, could lead you to instant ban skipping past warnings into termination.

The community is filled with very sweaty ass kissing weabos, who can not bother to teach the game because of how stupid they are at being a leader thinking that tanking is being a leader, never knew boulders could be leaders. 

PVP is dogshit, not very creative and so much wrong with the abilities the concept of how alliance is, you can aoe heal or pass on spell or abilities onto alliance members near you unless they are in your party; which to me makes no sense to the concept of ""Alliance"". 

Raids/Instances are all the same formula, just reskin map/creatures/bosses and tweak on abilities or phases, nothing more.

Job/Classes have been butcher since 1.0, making it easier for casual players; gear is bland dogshit stats, basic STR VIT INT MND and basic implementation of Critical hit/dmg, Accuracy, etc. Nothing great, new, no meta gear, no building interesting sets, it's just brain dead stat base. 

This game is heavy Glamour, Housing, Role playing your dick off, and botting. You will see a lot of botters, sadly. 

I have well more than 6k hours, about 35k+ hours since 1.0 era.

"There's a free to play mode that covers a ridiculous amount of amazing content,
If you're curious, there's no harm in trying it. 

I'm a WOW Refugee in FFXIV. I'm primarily speaking to WOW players considering trying out this game.
I've grown to love the character customization. The job system which means that I'm never splitting progress between alts. The consumer friendly company (and micro transactions).
However, more than anything I find the general attitude of the community to be friendly.

There are many things that are different to WOW, the Main storyline that you go through is a single player game worth of content on its own. It's unsettling as a wow player, but it gets really good.
It breaths life into your character by placing it into the world. 
I have yet to reach end game, but as far as I can tell, it's not about running dungeon and raids for Ilevel.
There's a healthy transmog system, brilliant character customization, really lets you make your character personalized.
There's functional crafting classes, with actual uses.
The server economies are working really well.
The raid mounts have a 100% drop rate, there are some trial mounts that don't have that, but a while after they come out, the boss starts dropping tokens, fail to get the mount from him until you have enough tokens:
Use the tokens to buy the mount from a vendor.
Looking at all the friends out there who have ran Ulduar for Mimiron's head since Cataclysm like me.

If you think this game has too many ""cat girls, and bunnies"" you're coming from a game with bipedal cattle,
pandas, foxes and werewolves. You'll be just fine.

The game is a little washed out  and grey when you log in, smack Alt+F3 on your Nvidia ingame panel and punch up the vibrancy. 

I was so used to WOW that I couldn't see a really really good alternative being available for nearly a decade.

"EDIT - After level 50 this game becomes painfully slow!
------------
If you're looking for your first MMORPG or if you're looking for something other than WoW to play. FFXIV is worth giving a shot. I'm playing a Paladin(Gladiator), level 55 with some crafting and gathering jobs around the same level... I haven't played any end game content yet but so far I'm really enjoying this game.

As a long time Wow Player (since 2008), here are some comparisons.. 

1. Compared to WoW, FFXIV is very heavy on the story and cut scenes, its pretty slow to start but picks up. It's hard to tell is the story is better than WoW because there is so much that you end up skipping a lot. I'm leaning towards FFXIV having a better story just because WoW has crammed so many expansions into the leveling process that it doesn't make sense anymore.
2. Crafting is fun and doesn't feel like a chore. Crafting also seems useful.
3. Travelling is a bit strange at first but the mechanic is much smarter. A lot less time watching your character run than WoW
4. No Addons. I was worried about this at first but it keeps the toxic damage meter elitists from shaming new players.
5. So far the boss and combat mechanics seem much easier than WoW
6. Personal opinion - The armour styles look way cooler. The art and graphics styles are also head and shoulders above WoW
7. Dungeons are shorter and much less grindy. Honestly FFXIV is a lot less grindy overall. Dungeons are fun so far but I haven't seen any complex mechanics yet.
8. FFXIV is more geared to PVE. There is PVP but its a small part of the game.

But the state of WoW has gotten so bad now, in terms of expansion direction (wq chores, other chores, gate keeping), and company direction (woke infested sjw pos, microtransactions ahoy), that ffxiv is now just so much better in comparison its not even funny. They didn't go woke, they didn't become so over bearingly formulaic with expansions based on psychological analysis of the metadata of player habits, they are just what they are and thats what I wanted WoW to have stayed as.

I've asked support to tell me how I can see if the DLC is active.
All of this for a game. Had I not paid 64 dollars for the whole thing, I would have given up.
The process is tedious and way too complicated, especially considering the cost of the game. There should be detailed instructions on how to link an existing account and Steam account. I have no idea how to pay the monthly after my initial 30 days are done.
The game itself, so far, is quite nice. I hope nothing ever goes wrong. I have no confidence in getting any kind of customer service to sort it. I'm assuming Steam is just the cashier. I scoured the interwebs for answers. There was nothing, not even in S.E.'s FAQs.",2021/05/07,0,0,0,0
"With EXTREMELY long winded and painful writing this game's story is really difficult to sit through. 

It also suffers from the typical MMO failings; with combat that feels like just hitting the same pattern of keys ad nauseum, worthless side quests (in terms of reward, experience, story, and gameplay) and a the awkward silence of reading chapters upon chapters of useless dialogue throughout all of the above. At one point in the main story the main story character I was talking to stopped to lean over the desk and sign some paperwork handed to her by the clerk, apropos of nothing.

The social spaces tend towards being a cringey hypersexualized anime nightmare that's more awkward than anything, tending towards what feels like a teenage boy's fantasy more than anything else. 

As a newcomer from the likes of World of Warcraft the ui and multiple game systems are not at all welcoming in their complexity and navigation. 

If you want to play dress-up and enjoy a virtual space this might be the game for you. You can be a cat person in lingerie, or an awkward childlike small person in their underwear, or a muscled out lion man in a thong. Many people do these things.
 
There's a literal entire Casino social space that almost solely employs Bunny-women who greet you ""Hey Handsome!"" in swimsuit like attire reminiscent of the Playboy Mansion; if you're into that sort of thing.

"Spoiler free - long review.
I am giving this a thumbs down, not because I think it is a bad game, but because I consider that after 11 years Square Enix did nothing to adress CORE problems of the game.
Namely Returning vs First Time player.
This game is great for a return player.
It is absolutely horrible for first time player.
The ""Best story in an MMO"" is nothing short of bad.
After ARR - which plays like a badly written GOT episode, the story format repeats THREE times:
""This is your villain, you will now deal with logistics, chores and whatnot for 20h, oh its time for final clash!""
The pacing of the story is horrible, with VOICED scenes between too scarce for a AAA+ premium MMO.

Lets break down the game:
The GOOD:
-Some music pieces are great
-Map and character design is amazing, this game is pure eyecandy on max settings
-Dungeon and Raid/Trial modes - When you finally get to them, these are quite fun
-Certain plot points were amazing, but the story is oriented towards two year olds to use these good parts
-Multiclassing on one character
-Nice mount options
-Great fashion options

The bad:
-Virtually no gearing until you play through entirety of 4 DLCs worth of ""STORY"" content
-Story quest design is without restraint, most vile generic fetch questing, fedex simulator, visual nover read, standing and time wasting. This game wants you to play LESS  as the time goes on. 
One quest has you knock on same doors three times, Lvl 70 quest has you collect dung, and finaly when you reach end game lvls (75+) they will be guiding you in with NPC introduction quests like you just started a F2P mmo on lvl1.
-This game features the most DEAD Overworld to date. I have never played a game and an MMO at that that is so wast and big but there are large, cool sections of the map where no secret or boss can be found.
-The game world feels static, fake and player-reactory. The world exists to ego boost the player and not cus it is fleshed out. NPCS emote mutely into thin air, nothing moves, including very depressing patrols by enemy mobs. It is as dead as it can get. Cities see some life but that is mainly people afking for queue, bards playing some music and people staring at the marketplace board.
-Telegraphed attacks and hit boxes - The game uses a ""surehit"" system where there is no way to dodge attacks if you were 0.2s in an aoe when it finished casting. I have, in countless events, teleported out of the zone of the attack just to get hit. It feels non-responcive and sluggish at times.
-LVL sync - Due to overtuning of gained EXP on story missions, you will at worse be overleveled for 10 lvls against the content you MUST go through. Unlocking skills becomes progressively tedious and the more you unlock, the less you will get to use them up untill you reach lvl 80 content.
-Zero class tuning, minmaxing or player influence to the story or character build
-----------------------------------------------
Closing words: 
The first time experience did not feel like an MMO. It felt like a very WEAK Final Fantasy game.
Heavensward was most well rounded expansion, it had epics, it had drama, it had lore. Story is consistent with the theme and compared to the rest it is peak FF14.
The MMO aspects ruin STORY (that is exclusively single player and game hates it when you are in a party)
STORY aspect ruins the MMO(it takes to much time, chore fetching to unlock good content, it grates you down)
IT feels like the team struggled to decide what kind of game this is and the  end product is very bare minimum for both.
After 11 years, the core mechanic introduced was just only ""Aether currents"" in Heavensward.
The world progresses  in no new or meaningful ways.  After playing MMOS for over 20 years now (Played most of them) I saw MMOS trying to add systems to the game, more content and core mechanics (Garrisons, Tower Defences, Forges, Industry, Rehauled Upgrading etc) This game has very little meaningful activities.
Gear upgrading is tedious and unfun. Gear acquisition is even worse. 
Overall - If you are a new player - Dish out 60$ more to buy a STORY SKIP ( I love anime and at most time the story is cringe, with world mechanics being forgotten and deus ex machinas and power of friends saving the day constantly, no one dies unless they are not needed and everyone becomes a friend)
If you are returning player - Come back and enjoy new end game content.

Pricing:  You need to by 2 by 2 sets of expansions, and only first time do you get free 30 days of game time.
For the asking price, you aren't really getting much, unless you like clicking through disconnected, inane text boxes written for mentally disabled ( It takes two DLCs for my mute Hero to understand what was explicitly said. In story arc they can say ""Oh X is evil and he has controll over Y"" it takes 20 missions or so of inspecting and confirming to  understand the fact. It is abysmal) 
And don't get me started on 45+minute  long videos after each DLC, all with end game credits.
Overall Dissapointing/10/",2021/05/07,10,4,0.516680657863616943,0
As far as MMOs go this is the only one that has been able to hold my attention since Phantasy Star Universe. It is a harsh but rewarding ride through the ARR content but once you get out of that it's a very solid and well thought out game and honestly ARR isn't THAT bad just pales in comparison to the rest of the content you get in further expansions. The latest expansion Shadowbringers is the game at it's best and honestly a great time to get into the game or back into it. The environments and character design are amazing and honestly I find myself in gpose a lot more than any other game's photo mode. If you are looking for an MMO with a good story and great end game content this is the one for you.,2021/05/06,0,0,0,0
"The system to enter this game is a fucking disgrace, I have been trying to register my account for at least two hours, having issues to recover my old one, to use a different email, to register a new email, its insane. 

To recover an account, you have to wait 24hs if you miss some information.
To register a new account, you get an error through the launcher (error code: i2501)
Using a completely new mail and new account through the website, you have issues registering the Steam product key.

After getting trough all that crap, it didn´t allow me to choose where I´m from so if I wanted to register a payment method in their own system, at Square Enix website, its a nightmare too, because I have the Steam account related to it and you need to provide information from a different country, and then, also you will have to pay more than 10 USD monthly to keep playing but they don´t make it any easy for you to want to pay that amount. 

I don´t know who did the integration between Steam and FF14 but it´s a big piece of ************.

Thank you for nothing Square Enix and Steam on this one, I won´t be playing this game even if you gift it to me.

By the way, it doesn't allow you to refund your Steam purchase, keep it you fu*** bastar**!",2021/05/06,2,0,0.5,0

Anyway, this game is really good I didn't think I would get into it that much + i'm currently playing with some friends and it's even more fun. I played WoW and it was good but the graphics were bad compared to FFXIV. That's what I love about this game are the insane graphics being just really good to me, the gameplay is really good as well, lots of scenes but it's part of the story you're not forced to watch them, the quest system is easy to use.

I started with a Ninja so probably not the easiest (found out in a poll it was the hardest one) lol but I really like playing with him, the gameplay is really interesting and you have a lot of mechanics to know and remembers (especially the mudras).

"Come into the game with the mentality to treat it as a Final Fantasy game first before treating it like an MMO to speed through all the way to current content. Theres lots to do in the game but theyve also set it up so that progressing and leveling is pretty simple and fast once you get past A Realm Reborn. The story gets VERY indepth and it would be a shame to skip out on it all for the sake of reaching current content and having no ties or connections to the ongoing events of the game. Play the game at your own pace as well, there is allot do but the game respects your time, so dont feel pressured into keep up with the game on a day to day basis or playing it forever.

"My favorite MMORPG so far. 

Combat starts a little slow but gets more and more engaging and fun as you level up and unlock more skills. Learning your rotation well enough to execute it smoothly feels really rewarding, especially while avoiding attacks and nailing positionals. The story is thoroughly enjoyable throughout the entire game. 

I've really only played Melee DPS as the Dragoon. I've never played an MMO that required such a long rotation in order to be fully effective. It's like a 20 button rotation. Luckily the skills get added slowly as you level so you have time to learn the basics and add onto it as you go, eventually having a full rotation while weaving Off Global Cooldown skills in between them. Very rewarding and engaging when your muscle memory gets a hold of it and you don't even sweat the full rotation anymore. 

The community has been excellent. The best MMO community I've experienced. A lot of people say Hello at the beginning of match made dungeons and say GG and Thank you at the end. If you let people know it's your first time running a dungeon, they tend to be very accepting of the fact and will let you know the main mechanics of Boss fights before you initiate them. 

I've only dabbled into crafting but I had found a few different items to craft that sold constantly, giving me a steady influx of Gil, really making you feel like you're part of an economy. There's crafting gear and tools for all of the professions. When you get into the mood to work on crafting, it begins to be really fun. There's a quality grind built into it and it pays off. I still remember breaking 1 million Gil for the first time (which is nothing compared to some of the people that have been playing all these years). 

The mounts are cool. Flying is available, but you have to unlock flying zone by zone. You usually unlock flying in a zone toward the end of your main questing in the area by collecting Aether Currents that are scattered throughout the map, so by the time you unlock flying in that zone, you're ready to move to the next, where you do not have flying unlocked yet. It ends up being beneficial because you end up going through older zones for future quests and having the ability to fly through them is like a reward for its completion. 

I've tried WoW, ESO, Neverwinter, Destiny, Runescape, The Division and other MMO's, but this is the one I keep coming back to. Relearning your rotation after taking a while off is the only barrier to re-entry. It all comes back after a few hours though. 

Easily recommended.",2021/05/02,0,0,0,0
"Fortunately enough, I got on the band wagon pretty early, and the struggle through ARR didn't seem like such a pain at the time as Heavensward had just released. I've learnt that there will pretty much always be someone better than me at just about everything you can do in this game, but at least they're nice about it. (Most of the time). There's Elitists, there's people that might make you want to minimise the size of your chat window. But there's also very kind, open and welcoming communities. It's a great game and the only MMORPG I've managed to put so much time and effort into, it's difficult to find a raid static but it can be done. 

If you want quicker queue times, there's now an AI mechanic that helps you match into dungeons, and most tank classes just feel like fat DPS'. ARR is streamlined and they're making efforts into making this game more in depth but also approachable. I'm not sure when I'll next pick up the game, but I'm sure at some point it will happen. I hope for more alliance raids, and less grindy southern fronts. But it's at least something to do and be proud of.",2021/05/02,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0

"Ok, so as someone who has over 200 hours and has ""completed"" the main story quests up to the end of the Shadowbringers expansion as well have done a good amount of the raids and trials both extreme and normal difficulties i believe i can safely write this review. 
Firstly, the Character creation is very good, the races are nice the customization is there yada yada. The classes, though difficult to understand at first, are all extremely in depth and well designed. They are interesting and each class feels different enough to fill it's own specific niche. A major positive for the game in my opinion. The other awesome benefit is you can level every single class and skill on a single character. You do not need to create dozens of characters to find the job you enjoy most. Dungeons though bland at first, are still very fun and unique, and there are enough of them to fill hours and hours of game time. Another big plus, is that (with a cash shop purchase) MAJORITY of the main story quests are able to be skipped. I'll explain why this is such a big plus later on. 
The jobs are fun and the cosmetic options the game provides you are very nice (both cash shop and otherwise). Dyes are not intrusive or difficult to apply. 
Now i confess I have not been able to purchase a player home as of yet, because they are so difficult to come by. This is a negative for me, as player homes are essentially sparse and you have to be very lucky and rich to acquire the necessary land to build one. However, the fact that player housing is even an option is still very nice. 
Ok so big negative for me is the story. I find the MSQ (Main Story Quest) of this game to be utterly intrusive, annoying, and unfun. That is why i used the cash shop skip for a large majority of the quests. That is not to say the entire story is bad. I played through about 1/4 of Realm Reborn, all of Heavensward, and all of Shadowbringers. The problem is the MSQ feels like a very boring chore that nobody wants to do. You will spend literal hours running back and forth between NPC""s (half of which are telling you the exact same thing)  and just rack up exp. It is boring and blande. Additionally, understand, YOU ARE NOT THE MAIN CHARACTER! Alphinaud, Cid, and all the other ""Main NPCS"" are the main characters, you are just putting in the work as the ""warrior or light"" blah blah. It is frustrating. I HIGHLY reccommend that you skip as much of the story as you can and simply play through the dungeons to level your characters. 
Now of course, this does come from the perspective of someone who has never played another FInal fantasy game. So it is entirely possible the story is not to my taste, and that is totally fine if you choose to play through it. I just don't think it's very good. 
Overall, the game is very very good. The classes are a massive strong point, each being very unique and intriguing to pick up and learn, and all fill a niche. Additionally, dungeon design and raids and trials are all very fun to do. I would very highly recommend this game outside of the MSQ, which thankfully you can pay to skip. If that is not worth it to you then enjoy! But be warned, it is tedious, especially since the game locks content such as dungeons and trials (the fun stuff imo) behind the tedious main story. Other than that, the game is a solid 8/10 for me! Enjoy!",2021/05/02,34,1,0.58631366491317749,0

"Fun.. but watch your wallet folks, they will rob you blind if you dont pay attention.  For example, if your new, or have a new account, Shadowbringers purchase will give you 30 days of playtime.  If you're a returning player and need Shadowbringers to continue with your friends or what not, guess what? You pay the $44 (after taxes) AND you get to pay for the month as well.  

Now.. while not reprehensible, that is a pretty cheap underhanded business model.  Not one I'm sure I want to support.  Thus I need to decide if I want a refund before logging in again, and then having to tell my guild that I'll not be re-joining them because I refuse to support this sort of underhanded business practice.

"Now being i big ff fan this may come across as a little biased. i played ff14 way back when it released on ps4, i enjoyed it although it was kinda slow and had next to no content available it was a bit of a scuffed launch but everyone already knows about that so i wont drone on. anyway i thought id try and dive back into things now the game is fully fleshed out and seems to be in a much better place and i dont regret a single second of the 15h daily sessions i have had since i re-subbed. once you slog through a realm reborn (the base game story) and trust me it is a slog great story but a slog, things get 100x better in heavensward the first DLC. the story is great the dungeons and bosses are on another level and i blew through the whole thing in 3 days no joke. im writing this review as im heading into stormblood at lv64 and 100h in. push through the beginning and you wont regret it 10/10 will sub again.

"As for FFXIV, it's a good MMORPG with a lot of indepth story wise. 

Pros:

x Unlike most MMO's, this game is NOT pay to win.  
x Fun community, met a lot of fun people. It's the first community in a game where everyone just has fun together, no one is excluded.
x For me personally, the amount of options when it comes to character customization is astonishing. Yes there are games out there, like BDO, that will allow you to change every inch of your body. But FFXIV's character options just hit different and feel less scuffed.
x SO. MANY. CLASSES. My favorite one is definitely Black Mage :]
x Naked egirls in Limsa B)

Neutral:

x End game = mainly grinding.
x The punishment system is rigged, but it's whatever really :]

Cons:

x Monthly subscription is required to play this game. It's not the first game that does this, obviously, but it's still 13 euros a month.
x Duty/Dungeon queues are insanely long at times, a bit unbalanced in my opinion.
x First 30 levels are pretty fucking boring lol.
x End game is a lot of grinding.
x Get ready for assholes leaving you hanging in a dungeon. Whether it's because they cannot play their class or they're just AFK for no reason, be ready for it lol.
x Lala's are the worst race and I cannot take them seriously, period.
x WHY IS EVERYONE NAKED IN LIMSA GUYS, PLEASE??????????????????????",2021/05/01,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0

"Okay, first ever review of a game lol... Hmm, where to even start? So, I... liked it. It was fun, especially with friends, this game really does encourage you to have four people, but me and my bud got along with two, using the random folks from the internet for our other squad members lol. 

And... hmm, liked the combat in the early game, later it gets super weird though, having to research all the differing attacks, buffs, and other things you get. The character customization is really nice, first real avatar of mine that I've liked, even roleplaying as her for a bit lol! 

But hmm, I can't think of much more positives, let's get into mixed before the negatives lol. So money. You won't have that. At least really early on, cause yeah, it's pretty hard to get when most items sell for one gil. And while you could craft, that's mostly just mindless. And EXP is very similar, enemies in the overworld feel like a chore to get through, and the amount of levels you need for them to not aggro you is 11 or higher. I get they don't want you to explore too much, especially as a new player, but 11 is way too many, especially at how long grinding takes late-game. 

Hmm, and let's just mention Quests, Fates, Levequests, and anything else like that. Because, while I love the recommendations option, always telling you all the quests in an area, any monsters you need to kill for your hunting log, etc... But if you're like me, who completes everything, all that will be left is Levequests, and FATEs. Solo, FATEs are impossible, don't even try. It takes forever for the swarms, and if it's a big boss, that's basically an instant loss, you can't defeat it alone. Which I get, it's MMO, but a major source of grinding is just lost to the people who play solo, or split off from their friends due to differing classes, etc... So all that's left is Levequests, which are tedious. Do the same mission, get a small percentage of EXP for your next level, rinse and repeat. The main quests and side quests are amazing though, just fun to do, give good Gil and EXP, I wish there were more of those! But as someone who's basically done everything in every area so far, yeah, it's not too pleasant to just do the same missions over and over again. Also, those side quests are shared across every class, so if you ever wanna switch, good luck getting your new one to a high enough level to even challenge the remaining quests, or grind at levequests! Because, yeah, those are the only remaining source of EXP, monsters give nothing, dungeons are locked at level 15, and all your main ways of getting levels have been done by the prior class! Just, yeah, this isn't fun to grind in, no, scratch that, it is fun to grind in, just all the fun ways are one time things!

Now, biggest thing I'm disappointed by. The actual story itself. I am only just about done the main game, all the quests are level 50 now, and... while it did make a slight upward swing towards it's end, the game's just lacking. Like, yeah, I tried, I really did try to get invested in all the characters, all the lore, everything but... No, it didn't happen. Okay, let me try to explain without spoilers... 

The one bit I actually liked were your job quests, the things you take to learn new class skills. Those are really fun, have their own mini stories, and are pretty specific to each class, and in turn, your character. They all end right when you promote too, each arc wrapping up nicely and it truly feels like you did something that mattered. Too bad they're stuck behind level caps, meaning if you wanna see 'em all, that means more grinding via levequests! Yay... But those stories are good, the issue is...

The main story sucks. The group you eventually become a part of is rather disconnected from you except for the occasional appearance in a main quest, plus the one you are ""close"" with is entirely reliant on your town, which that itself is reliant on your class. So, you have your main group person, that you can't really choose, unless you waste the ten early-game levels for a specific town, and then you have the people who are just in the story no matter what you do. Let's make this quick, Town leaders suck, leader of the group is cute but no real personality, and villains? If there is a single villain who you can remember the name of, I will be impressed. Like wow, the ""conflict"" in this story is so non-existent lol. The only reason you play it is for the EXP! Because yeah, it gives a ton, so you're gonna play it to unlock things and all, but... will you remember it? Is it an experience that really wows you? Like this is my first time really playing a Final Fantasy, kings of the RPG genre, and this is the story I get? Like, for real?

Okay, there's one character I like. You meet them late-game, they have amnesia, if you played the game, you know who I'm talking about, I think. They're cool, really liked any scene with them in it, felt like an actual person in this RPG, who'd have thunk that's an accomplishment lol? 

But yeah, I know I've been harsh, complaining is really easy, but if you have four friends who can be active consistently? Yeah, this game is a no-brainer. There's some really fun things here, but I think that may be because this is my first real experience with the genre lol. And there's so many hidden systems that I'm sure I missed, but this game does have awful tutorials and like the smallest text size known to man... Hey, the world's lively, if you know how online interaction works, you may be able to make some friends here! 

But as for me? It's tough, cause the stuff that works really does work lol. Hunting specific enemies, completing recommendations, doing the job quests, character customization, learning how to actually be good in your class, this all feels really fun. 

The downsides are also quite large though, inability to successfully switch classes, meaning you are locked to one for the base game, usually the starting one, which probably won't be your best fit. The whole town system, making starting at the same place with friends either impossible or one of you will probably have to be have to change classes to do dungeons, which also sucks. The unfairness of single player grinding, there being no way to do solo dungeons, Fates, or any other forms of multiplayer grind methods, leaving only Levequests left, especially if you completed all the side stuff in an area. The main story (at least for the base game, the DLC may be perfection incarnate, who knows?) absolutely being an absolute bore, your main character sticking out like a sore thumb, and every other person being either uninteresting or devoid of any real personality/struggles, except for one main person and a couple NPCs. 

Just... yeah, it has to be a no for me, to my past self, at least for the $60 + over a hundred in subscription fees. You aren't going to find those amazing characters you hoped for, the plot is basically a generic RPG one, just worse by no party members, cool villains, actual overworld changes, or any real stakes. It's fun, but not almost three full priced games worth of it. There's many good bits, countless fun moments too, but that's all occasional gameplay, having fun with your online friend, and getting to make a cute girl. There are far better games that provide these things, and are just better.

To end this off, you have four friends, can play regularly, and just are really not looking for a good story? Yeah, this works. Try and beat it by under $100, it definitely isn't worth that much. In fact, just don't get the DLC until after you beat the main game. Maybe it can be $60 at that point, but even at that price? 7.5/10, minus a point for every $20 extra. So... 2.5/10 for me, but still would recommend. You just have to play it fast, have low expectations, and preferably have people to play with. So yeah, give it a shot if you think that applies, if not...? Well, I told you my story lol. Hope it helps lol!",2021/05/01,1,0,0.523809552192687988,0

"TL/DR: Played 15h in my Free Trial, Came back after 1 Year to become addicted!


Oh, here is the Window for this.
Ok, so I never in my Life wrote a Review for something, but I guess there is a first Time for everything as they say.
I originally started last Year for a short 10-15h to see what the Game was about.
Back then, I played all of that Time in 2 Sittings. So I knew I would ""Burn out"" eventually.
Hence, I lay the Game aside for some Time.
So, I believe 20 Days from writing this I started playing the Game again, and just now realized,
I played for an average of 13h a Day. And Truth be Told, I don't regret it. I mean, I don´t understand the Game at all.
It has So many Possibilities on how you can Play it, that it may seem overwhelming.
But I found a few Friends without even Trying.I loved the Questing, until I ran out of Quests/SIdequests.
Now I spend most of my Day grinding Fates and trying to find the Perfect Class for my Playstyle.
It doesn't matter what kind of Gamer you are.
The Grinder, Min-maxing everything.
The Farmer, Chopping Wood or Hitting Ores.
The Mobber, who all he does is Kill Mobs´.
The RP-Player, sitting in Towns in ""RP"" Mode all day interacting with People.
The Fashionist, trying to get that Perfect Look to make other People jealous.
Etc. etc., etc.
This Game has something for everyone.
And even if you do not Like/understand something at first. You do not need all of these Things.

"(disclaimer: my first actual review so bear with me.)

I've played many fantasy games and MMOs over the years, but i would say this is my favourite. It may take a while to get started story and combat pacing-wise, as you don't have many abilities at first, but as you level up, it gets more and more engaging. 
The story grew on me over time, and the story comes into its own by the start of Heavensward, and only goes up from there. I went from being bored to feeling genuine emotion with the characters and tearing up at points. I would say try the free trial and see if you like the game, as it goes upto level 60 and the end of the first expansion, Heavensward. 
I would say with the upcoming Endwalker expansion later this year, it is one of the best times to start playing this wonderful game.

"good god no 
squenix doesn't make good games
mmorpgs aren't good games
do the math

oh also the community is openly hostile and unhelpful
in the spirit of that I shan't be taking questions

it's just so plainly obvious that this is missing so many basic quality of life things
why does talking to people force you to dismount? why ever would you ever do that ever ffs 

I spend more time managing inventories than anything else
GREAT JOB GUYS YOU MADE A SATISFYING GAME RIGHT

feeding chocobos needs to be done with one bit of food at a time and the screen fades out and fades in for no fucking reason and needlessly delays the whole thing
not only that but you can`t just feed your chocobo from anywhere in the world even tho you can start a race from anywhere in the world
the whole game is like this it's just goddamn nonsense, what a sloppy shitpile

do you have the items necessary to craft something but some of it is in a retainer slot or in your chocobo's saddlebag? I hope you like an extra minute of menuing
you already knew this would be grindy but did you also know that the grind is itself horribly paced and disorganized?
unless you set up a bunch of macros (yawn) then switching between classes to craft things is also bullshit
why would it not just have you autoswitch when you choose something to craft? why do you have to leave the crafting menu and re equip another class every time? why can't you just change what gear you're equipping while you're in the crafting menu? so so so inexcusably bad

you can`t even finish fucking class quests without changing to that class
I cannot fathom why, I truly cannot, it is just so fucking stupid

quests don't show up on the minimap by default 
the UI is crowded and awful
raids are the least fun part of the game and you HAVE to do them there is just no way around it and the duty finder (the method by which you join raids) is fucking awful
it is just so bad 

also there's a race of loli people which is already gross but then there are no actual children which just makes it even weirder so uh
what the fuck squenix

this game exists to grift people
there are 18 dollar aesthetic only DLCs and a million other pieces of worthless merchandise to milk the stupid sheep who base their life on this garbage",2021/04/29,1,1,0.225829735398292542,0
"Overall, the story might come off as bland and slow, but quickly pieces together a very interesting world. The game play up until around level 30-50 is quite slow and will leave you pressing the same few buttons over and over again but ramps up quickly to an almost insane pace at late game keeping those interested in having to manage global cooldowns and oGCDs while dodging attacks in quick paced beautiful fights. 

The PvP is a chaotic mess, but truly enjoyable if you're able to take the reins of around 50 players in your team and have them work together to overcome your opponents with strategic timing and good positioning, usually hard, but fun nonetheless as you use spells otherwise much more harder to access in this combat against other players. 

Music is a absolutely amazing from minute one of the game.

UI-HUD- is made extra manageable with Macros to activate and deactivate menus and hud elements with ease, as well as repositioning or resizing in the UI manager.

"My Dearest Martha,

I need to tell you about my time in Final Fantasy XIV. At first it was enjoyable enough, lots of quests meeting various fantastical characters and bringing items from one person to another. I was having fun, but it was undeniably something I had done in many MMO games over the years. Over time though I became immersed in this fantasy world. I started to ""get"" what set this MMO above others. In a word, it's just fun.

This game is less worried about bringing people together to bang their heads against the walls of multiplayer content. It would rather tell a large sweeping story where your character is the protagonist and a story that can be enjoyed with others as well.

It was a slow start, but by the time I had made it to the first expansion I was hooked.

Oh and the dragons in it are way better than the dragons in ESO. That's just a fact.

I hope this letter finds you well Martha. I don't suspect I shall see Little Timmy, Sally, John, Leviticus, or yourself again. My fight is in Eorzea now, and I must needs remain here.

Yours in this life and the next,
Revendawn",2021/04/29,45,44,0.761239588260650635,0

However, I watched the fan festival, and I can't say anything bad about this game, not even as a joke. I love it too much. The game, the community, even the staff!

"FFXIV:ARR is an all round fantastic MMORPG that implements some new systems that I personally haven't seen in any other MMORPG. I am a longtime WoW player and decided to give this MMORPG a go due to WoW kind of getting boring (thats a personal opinion) and I am glad i did give this MMORPG a shot, the graphics, the gameplay, the classes, the story etc everything about this game feels fresh to me and i am loving the adventure ive been on. 10/10 in my opinion. Don't get me wrong it's definitely not perfect lets be real like every other game it has its downfalls but, again, in my opinion i feel like its a game that has the smallest or least amount of negatives then any other game out there. If your looking for something fresh and different i highly recommend giving this game a try, best part about this game its completely FREE TO PLAY up until level 60 which is LITERALLY the entire base game and im fairly certain the first expansion completely FREE with the free trial, so why not give it a try? if you dont like it delete, if you do then purchase it!",2021/04/28,2,0,0.545454561710357666,0

"This game is saving me so much money from impulse buys. 9/10

Game's story starts off pretty slow and rampant in fetch quests, but turns to one of the most engrossing Final Fantasy stories of all time. The story is accentuated with its myriad of nuanced villains, and its wonderful world building. 

The class/Job system is pretty damn great. All classes can be played on one character, making it so much easier to experience all the roles and all the combat system has to offer in enjoyment. You're a tank main who wants to try healer role? Easy peezy, just switch.

The base game and first expansion is free for all to try with no time limit, Easily a 100 hour free experience.

I got 777 hours played in this game, running end game content and leveling other classes. I still feel like there's a loot of game left for me to experience.",2021/04/27,0,0,0,0
